            "    vi    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS    The idea and motivation for this work emerged  majorly  from a lecture delivered at the   University of Zambia’s School of Engineering entitled “Economics of Distributed   Resources”. Zambia , the country of analysis is of special interest to me as my domain country   that belongs to the emerging countries whose econ omic development is driven by  wood fuel,   hydropower save for  the depletion of fossil resources. Given today’s carbon -constrained    world, it was impera tive to evaluate the competitiveness of alternative energy sources.    The research wouldn’t have been  made  possible without the valuable professional, moral and   financial support from others. First and foremost, I take the opportunity  to thank my   supervisor/lecturer Dr. A Zulu for the valuable academic guidance and inspiring brain -  storming aside  discussions we h ad together, which eventually helped me research into  this   interesting topic.    Furthermore, I would like to give special thanks to all my lecturers  at UNZA  especially Prof.   F Yamba, Dr. H Mwenda, Dr. L Ngoyi, Dr Simate, Dr. M Chileshe, and Mr Virdy, for th eir   excellent academic support and guidance.

To describe the spectrum of CVD manifestation in asymptomatic diabetic patients    Specific    1. To document the subclinical (Sc) CVDs on ECG, ECHO    2. To correlate the various ScCVD with level of sugar control based on HbA1c including   the prevalence of silent myocardial ischemia in diabetic patients    3. To determine the risk factors associated with ScCVD       1.5 Study justification    Diabetes has long been recognized to be an independent risk factor for CVD. Individuals with   diabetes have twice the incident myocardial infarction (MI) rate as the general population, and   survival rates are lower among individuals with diabetes once they have an adverse   cardiovascular event.48 Women with diabetes and CVD, regardless of menopausal status, have   a four - to six -fold increase in the risk of developing CVD, whereas men with diabetes have a   two- to threefold increased risk  of CVD compared to women and men without   diabetes.6,8  Diabetes acts as an independent risk factor for several forms of CVD. To make   matters worse, when patients with diabetes develop clinical CVD, they sustain a worse   prognosis for survival than do CVD patients without diabetes.6, 7, 8 Because individuals with   diabetes are at higher risk for CVD events than individuals without diabetes and are at risk for   future events if they have already had one, it is necessary to screen all patients with diabetes  for   cardiovascular complications.    The association of subclinical cardiovascular manifestations with level of glycemic control will   be evaluated in this study. Early detection of these subclinical cardiovascular manifestations   could help institute prevent ative measures to prevent progression of these cardiovascular   complications.   \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT    The study is an investigation  of institutional arrangements for supply of water and sanitation   services in Chinsali Urban, Zambia.  The study aimed at assessing the instituti onal   arrangements for supply of water and sanitation services in Chinsali Urban in Muchinga   Province.  The objectives of the study were to identify the institutional arrangements for water   supply and sanitation services in Chinsali Urban,  to assess how the institutional arrangement s   affect water supply and sanitation services in Chinsali Urban  and t o assess the challenges and   opportunities of service delivery for water supply and sanitation  services  in Chinsali Urban.    The significance of the study was to gat her information on how institutional arrangements   affect the supply of water and sanitation services in urban areas. It will add to the body of   knowledge on challenges and opportunities of institutions and Commercial Uti lities (CUs).   Furthermore , policy ma kers in the water supply and sanitation services sec tor will be able to   make periodic assessments  on how institutional arrangements can further improve service   delivery. The study used a mixed method approach of qualitative and quantitative  methods  to   collect data in the field.  From 557 households connected to the CU reticulation system, 139   households were stratified and proportionally sampled  using probability  simple  random   sampling  according to residential density cluster,  while purposive sampling was us ed on two   key informants from the CU and one from Chinsali Municipal Council and probability  simple    random  sampling was used for communities with water Kiosks. The instruments for   collecting data included questionnaires, semi -structured interviews, focus g roup discussions,   field observations and documen ts review. Quantitative data were  analysed using  descriptive   statistics and  Percentage Analysis Technique (PAT) , while qualitative data were analysed   using content analysis.  The study  findings  showed that the  institutions that are responsible for   supply of water and sanitation services in Chinsali Urban are the Community Based   Organisations (CBOs), Chambeshi Water and Sewerage Company (ChWSC) as the CU,   Chinsali Municipal Council (CMC) Water Supply and Sanitat ion Unit responsible for urban   water supply and sanitation services and the Ministry of Local Government and Housing   (MLGH) through the Department of Housing and Infrastructure Development (DHID). The    study revealed that  the current water supply does not m eet the current water demand of the   population of Chinsa li Urban . From the 139  households , (61 percent)  received water between   one hour and four hours per day.  Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) also showed that water   supply was insufficient in communities tha t use water Kiosk s. O nly ten percent of the   households are connected to  the sewerage system of the CU . Respondent s were satisfied with   the billing and affordability of the water supplied by the CU. Challenges that ChWSC faces   are dilapidated infrastructure ; power outages and administrative bureaucracy due to   provincial separation . Water supply interruptions and limited sanitation services due to   population increase were the challenges faced by households. Findings from the study   showed that Chinsali Urban h as the necessary institutional arrangements for supply of water   and sanitation services like other urban areas in Zambia.  Four institutions were identified   (CBO), (ChWSC), (CMC) and (MLGH). The institutional arrangements  in Chinsali Urban   have  affected the delivery of water supply and sanitation services  in the negative and positive   way as evident from the findings in the study.  The major challenges to WSS services are   dilapidated infrastructure and power outages which reduces the CU ’s capacity from    performi ng at the expected level as service provision is compromised.  Chinsali Urban has   good opportunities to increase and improve WSS services due to the current project for WSS   services funded by the MLGH. The project is expected to increase water supply from t he   current 2,600m3/day to 7,400m3/day if and  when the project is finished.

            "v    ABSTRACT    Many people in the world lack safe basic drinking water sources and rely on untreated water   sources. Unsafe drinking water is responsible for transmission of diseases such as Cholera,   Dysentery and Typhoid.  Packaged water can be considered as an alternative to other water   sources  if measures are put in place to ensure its safety for human consumption.  Studies prior to   this one focused on the quality of water sold in Lusaka regardless of the district the water is   produced from.  There has also been less focus on the quality contro l measures that may   influence quality.    A cross -sectional study was conducted to assess the bacteriological and chemical quality of   packaged water produced in Lusaka and associated quality control m easures.   Water samples   from 17  companies producing packa ged water in Lusaka were analyzed for total and feacal   coliforms as well as concentrations for Lead, Chromium and Cadmium. Stata version 15 was   used for data analysis.  The fisher’s exact test was used to test for associations between the   quality of packag ed water and quality control measures.    The study found that 35.3 percent  of the packaged water produced in Lusaka did not comply   with the standard for drinking water on bacteriological quality. It also found that the   concentrations for Lead were less than  0.01mg/l in all the 17  samples, thus compliant to   WHO/ZABS standards.   Concentrations of Chromium were between 0.002mg/l and 0.62mg/l   and co mpliance to the standard was 11.8  percent.   Concentrations for Cadmium were as low as   0.009mg/l and as high as 0.2 mg/l as such, non -compliant . All brands of packaged water from   companies inspected quarterly by Lusaka City Council were compliant to the bacteriological   standards of drinking water.  Packaged water produced by companies that own bacteriological   laboratori es accounted for 47.1 percent  of satis factory results while only 17.3 percent  were   satisfactory from companies without bacteriological laboratories .  None of the companies had   means of removing heavy metals from water during processing.     Both the bacterio logical and chemical quality of the packaged water need to be improved to   safeguard the health of the people. Processing of the water should therefore target removal of all   bacteria and heavy metals.  Government agencies should also monitor the companies r egularly to   ensure compliance to standards.  \n",

            "vi    ABSTRACT       Mining is an important economic activity in many developed and developing countries and has   the potential to  shape and affect economies directly and indirectly. Zambia is regarded as a   mining country because of the contribution of mining to its exports, domestic markets,   employment, and opportunities for economic growth and diversification.  Zambia produces 5   percent of the world‟s copper production and it has been generally increasing since 2000. The   increased production has led to quick depletion of ore reserves. The depletion of copper ore   reserves would seriously threaten economic growth and stability. The cop per resources available   to existing mines in Zambia are estimated at 2.8 billion tonnes of ore ranging between 0.6 and   4.0 percent copper. In addition, Zambia has potentially recoverable ores estimated at 1.6 billion   tonnes ranging between 0.4 and 0.5% cop per. In Zambia, economically recoverable copper   deposits are those with grades more than 0.5% for surface mining and more than 1.5 percent for   underground mining. In countries like Chile, Australia, and Canada, deposits at 0.4 percent and   1.0 percent are e conomically extracted by surface and underground mining respectively. Because   copper mining industry is an important economic activity for Zambia,  there is need to   investigate possibilities of economically mining marginal copper ore reserves. The purpose of   this research is therefore to investigate, analyse and determine Zambia‟s potential for mining low   grade copper deposits. If economically mineable, the low -grade deposits will increase copper   reserves from 2.8 billion to 4.4 billion tonnes. The addition al resources would prolong mining   for approximately 30 years.       In order to determine techno -economic potential for mining Zambia‟s low grade copper deposits,   the study had to review the existing data on low grade deposit through literature survey. The   mine ral resources classification and codes of reporting systems were evaluated and it was   revealed that Zambia has not developed a code for the reporting of exploration results, mineral   resources and mineral reserves. It is therefore recommended to employ modi fied United Nations   Framework Classification (UNFC) to develop a Zambia‟s code. The study also analysed macro -  environmental factors affecting Zambia‟s potential for mining low grade copper ore deposits.   PESTLE and SWOT analysis were used to evaluate the ex ternal and internal macro   environmental factors. A more accurate multi -criteria decision making model for PESTLE   analysis was developed and applied. The results indicate that the level of the macro environment   is moderately favorable to mining of low grade  copper ore deposits at the current situation. If   Zambia has to attract credible investors in the mining sector, the country has to improve its   macro -environment level. This can be achieved by addressing the country‟s weaknesses   identified in the SWOT anal ysis.       Kakosa South low grade copper ore deposit was selected as a case study. Kakosa is located about   450km northwest of Lusaka, the capital city of Zambia. In Kakosa area, the footwall aquifer   rocks comprising sandstone and conglomerates are thin and as  such are not expected to represent \n",

Anaesthesia is internationally recognised as one of the most inherently stressful medical   disciplines and this is often compounded by unique challenges within the anaest hetic care   provider’s working environment. It is important , therefore, to assess the extent to which   burnout affects Zambian anaesthetic care providers  as patient safety, the physical and m ental   health of the anaesthetic care provider  and the efficient ins titutional running are all risked in   the presence of burnout.    The study therefore aimed to determine the prevalence of burnout syndrome among anaesthetic   care providers working in Zambian hospitals and to determine which sociodemographic and   occupational f actors were more predictive of burnout.     A cross sectional study among 160 anaesthetic care providers (out of an estimated total of 184)   working in various public and private hospitals in Zambia was performed using the Maslach   Burnout Inventory -human servi ces survey , a validated tool, which is widely used  to assess the   presence of burnout  among health professionals . Sociodemographic and occupational factors   postulated to be associated with burnout were also assessed using a separate structured   questionnaire.    Burnout syndrome was detected in 51% of the 160 respondents, of these 86% were non -  physician anaesthetists  working in diff erent hospitals in the country.  Logistic regression   analysis revealed that “not having the right team to carry out work  to an appropriate standard”   (odds ratio 2.91 95% C.I. 1.33 -6.39, p=0.008), and being non -physician (odds ratio 3.4, 95%   C.I. 1.25 -12.34, p=0.019) were the strongest predictors of burnout in this population.     Burnout levels among Zambian anaesthetic care p roviders are high. The study findings suggest   that i ncreasing the numbers of providers in general may reinforce the hospital anaesthetic team   structure thereby reducing isolation. Furthermore, investing in training more physician   anaesthetists may be prote ctive.       Keywords: anaesthesia, burnout, human resources        \n",

            "iv    ABSTRACT    Past and present -day erosion is a significant form of land degradation that has   rendered vast areas of sloping land unproductive with respect to  crop production.   Thus, conservation tillage, along with complementary practices such as  soil cover   and crop diversity has become a better option to ensure sustainable food production   and maintenance of environmental sustainability. A field study was conducted to   evaluate the effect of dry wheat straw mulching and cowpea -maize intercropping   practices on soil erosion and maiz e yield . The field experiment  was conducted  at the   University of Zambia, Great East Road Campus Field Station, in Lusaka, which is   managed  by the School of Agricultural Sciences . The study aimed at assessing the   effect of mulching and intercropping practic es on soil  erosion  and runoff, water   balance and components of the Universal Soil Loss Equation. The study was carried   out in the 2016/2017 rainy season with maize as a test crop. A randomized complete   block design was adopted with three  replicates. Treatments were (i) dry wheat   mulching , (ii) cowpea -maize intercropping and (iii) conventional practices.  The   results showed that the use of dry wheat straw mulch at the rate of 12 ton/ ha could   reduce the amount of soil lost by 14  % as compar ed to the intercropping practice.   The runoff was not significantly affected by the dry wheat mulch and cowpea -maize   intercrop . The annual soil loss predicted from the Universal soil loss equation was   significantly reduced by 58  % in the dry wheat mulch and  29 % in the cowpea -  maize intercrop as compared  to the conventional practice . The non -significance of   the maize yield obtained would have been due to the infestation of Army worms    during the maize tasselling  stage.     Key words: soil loss, runoff, conservat ion tillage, crop diversity                  \n",

            "v    Abstract    E-government is intended to enhance the access to and delivery of government services to   benefit citizens, business partners and employees while reducing corruption and costs but   increasing transparency and revenue growth on the other hand.    Despite the fo regoing, the use of ICTs in both public and private sector, at individual and   institutional levels, has brought about a spectrum of ethical challenges in our societies  thereby   undermining efforts made to encourage citizens adopt the use of electronic servi ces deployed for   public service . The objectives of this research were to establish what ethical issues arise in e -  government implementation especially in developing countries, in this case Zambia and the   impact these ethical issues have on e -government imp lementation. In addition, to understand   how IT systems can be designed to address the identified ethical issues that arise in e -  government.    From the research, it was established that the prominent ethical issues that arise in e -government   implementation are security and privacy.  44% of the respondents agree, in addition to 28% who   strongly agree, that the inclusion of ethical issues in planning of e -government will contribute to   the successful implementation of e -government.  Only 38.5% of the respondents affirm that the   current e -government policy address es these ethical issues in e -government implementation   while 30.8% disagree and another 30.8% are not sure.    This study recommends  that a holistic approach to the addressing of these ethical issues should   be adopted by governments  to avoid formulation of policies in silos. The design of such policies   must precede any systems design as systems design must manifest efforts to address the ethical   issues that arise in the use of the particular system s concerned  using Value Sensitive Design .  \n",

            "V    ABSTRACT       The st udy was designed to explore the challenges and factors affecting government from taxing   the informal sector .   A mixed methods study design was adopted and 60 traders were enrolled in the study. A short   survey questionnaire and in -depth interviews were used to collect data for this study.   Quantitative data was analysed using SPSS version 16 and qualitative data was  analysed using   content analysis.    It was not expected that the traders would not be aware of any tax. In this sample, all the traders   were not aware of withholding and turnover tax es. They were however aware of Domestic VAT   and Base Tax.  The payment of do mestic tax (n = 35; 58.7%) was higher than that of Base tax (n   = 14; 23.3%. N = 14 (68%) paid Base tax  leaving n = 9 (32%) who were not. Regarding   domestic tax, only n = 2 (8.6%) were not paying this tax as compared to n = 33 (91.4%) who did.   Compliance wa s associated with costs  of punishment. Others paid tax because they saw it as a   moral obligation while others were compelled to pay tax because they had trusted in the   government in terms of its manifesto and the services it was offering. As for evasion, the level of   knowledge p layed a significant role in paying tax among these traders. Some traders opted to pay   some taxes whereas other paid both. They cited unfairness in the prescription of amounts to be   paid as well as persons to pay. They found it justifying to evade paying ta xes or under declare   taxes as they fall due. Others did not see any need to trust the government as services were not   top and there was a lot of corruption.    The study concludes that t he high number of traders and the variability and mobility in their   operations, is likely to make it difficult for even the most capable tax authorities to effectively   administer these taxes. Education campaigns that raise awareness about the benefits that result   from the taxes collected, and about the efforts made by tax auth orities to reduce unfairness (such   as introducing low but graduated tax rates according to turnover for instance), may also improve   tax morale and ultimately revenue collection.

            "Integrat ion of HIV and AIDS into Primary Curriculum: Teacher Training Curriculum     International Journal of Humanities Social Sciences and Education (IJHSSE)                               Page | 128  Other topics sho uld include self -awareness, male circumcision, unsafe sex, sexual harassment,   interpersonal communications, adherence, and assertiveness.     HIV education should other related issues and not limited HIV and AIDS alone, but also include   diet needs, use of app ropriate medicines and drugs, gender equality, and support areas such as   protective devices and interaction with health personnel. In this respect MoE should involve   closely with the Ministry of Health. This is because teachers deal with children living wi th HIV   (CLHIV) on a daily basis in their classrooms, and health workers deal with PLHIV in the   community at large.     Teach appropriate Behavior Change Communication (BCC), including sound values, morals, and   principles, and encourage children and parents to  interact with each other, especially teaching   parents to find time to be with and talk to their children about sexuality and HIV.     These responses from several participants demonstrated that there were many gaps in what is   supposed to be taught in primary  schools. These findings therefore show that there is a need for a   comprehensive HIV integrated curriculum that goes beyond theory toward one that is implemented as   part of all teacher training programs for PITs. In order to accomplish this it will be impo rtant to   continue to receive government support from the MoE at the national, provincial, and district levels as   well as from key stakeholders at all levels of the teacher training process.  The support must be   towards comprehensive curriculum development and training the trainers of trainers.    3.3. Effective implementation of an HIV integrated curriculum approach in real teaching   settings.    Because there was such variance in what was being taught about HIV education at the participating   teacher training institutions, it was difficult to fully answer this question. However, some general   findings include :     Most HIV education courses offered at the participating TTIs were electives and not required for   pre-service and/or in -service teachers.     For pre -service  and in -service teachers who elected to enroll and take HIV education courses   offered as part of their teaching degree/ certificate programs, they were able to receive quality   instruction and examples on how to integrate HIV into their respective disciplin e areas.     Teacher trainers are limited in what they can require to be taught on HIV in their respective   subject areas, especially if the topics are not on the formal, examinable part of the curriculum.     Teachers in Zambian primary schools are often limited  in what HIV instruction they can offer,   largely because of a lack of sufficient text book examples. More should be done to help provide   integrated examples of HIV in core (if not all) subject areas.     3.4. What role does counseling about HIV and AIDS play in th e early grade levels of primary   education?    Most respondents felt that primary schools should employ and train Guidance and Counselling (G&C)   Teachers. Most administrator (55.3%), teacher trainer (60.0%), pre -service teacher (73.6%), and in -  service teacher (87.5%) respondents felt that teachers should have a certificate in HIV prevention and   counseling to help their students better understand about HIV and to help them make good decisions   related to the disease. But responses on how to certify teachers varie d substantially by respondent   groups, and included anything from a one -day or perhaps a one -week training program to one that is   more comprehensive and is a stand -alone and required course -based (examinable) program of pre -   and in -service teacher training programs.    Counseling plays a crucial role in the instruction of learners at all levels, including in the early -grade   levels. The majority of CAE respondents felt that learners needed to be taught and counseled about   HIV and AIDS as early as possible, and most definitely not to wait until when they reach puberty.   Many CAEs cautioned that the HIV and sexuality instruction should be age -specific, but that HIV   education should begin as early as Grades 1 -4.    The knowledge students acquire must be gradual but in cremental. Some suggested in terms of grades   as starting from pre -school to Grade 3. Others added that children could be taught different messages \n",

            "Value of Traditional Ceremonies in Socio -Economic Development. A Case of Some Selected Traditional   Ceremonies in Zambia     International Journal of Humanities Social Sciences and Education (IJHSSE)                                Page | 139 chiefdom and also contributing funds towards the ceremony. A good example is the 2019 Kulamba   traditional ceremony where the chiefdom partnered with different NGOs in helping improve the girl   child education. These girls are the future development actors o f the chiefdom. Kalonga Gawa Undi   has observed that promoting child education and ending early marriages in his vast kingdom is such   an involving task. For this reason, he has allowed various Non -Governmental Organisation (NGOs)   operate in the kingdom to p romote child education and end early marriage. Among these NGOs are   SAWA, Paralegal, Network for People living with HI V/AIDS (NPLHA), KWATU, PLAN   International, YES I DO, Neighbourhood and Safe -motherhood.    These NGOs have different agendas in the kingdom.  For example, Paralegal ha veformed groups from   the villages that conduct meetings with community members on the danger of early marriages and   teenage pregnancies. They also talk about the advantages of educating a girl child as well as child   education in g eneral. They also have meetings with teenage boys and girls where they explain issues   of abstinence, working hard at school, use of condoms and distribute condoms where possible. It must   be mentioned that these organizations work with the help of subordina te chiefs and village headmen   who coordinate meetings with community members. Organization such a Paralegal and Plan   International have gone further in distributing bicycles to facilitators of such programmes in the   community. USAID is also using education  development assistance and PEPFAR funding to assist the   Ministry of Education with strengthening educational support for vulnerable students in its   community schools. They have also put up posters that promote sending boys and girls to school and   ending e arly marriages. These partnerships contribute to the development of the kingdom.      2.9. Potential Challenges    Traditional ceremonies, if not well handled, may create room for promotion of ethnicity and tribalism.   Much as traditional ceremonies promote cohesiveness especially among members of a particular   ethnic group or tribe, excessive emphasis should not be on p romotion of that group‟s culture as   superiority to other local cultures as doing so may lead to ethic and tribal conflict. Emphasis should be   on promotion of uniqueness of that group‟s cultural activities and what others may learn from them.    Traditional c eremonies risk turning into political battlefield if organisers of such events do not treat   them as apolitical ceremonies. Traditional ceremonies have the potential to create a battleground for   infidelity, promiscuity and for many other risk behaviours tha t support the spread of Sexuality   Transmitted Infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS. They create a market for sex tourists and sex workers.    Since traditional ceremonies have the muscle attract people from all corners of the nation, region and   world, they also po tential refugee camps for externals. These events may open the area to aliens who   may come with ill intentions of thieving, human trafficking and other dangerous acts which could   have been not common in the area.    Much as partnerships with state and non-state are good for local development, organisers of the events   must be worry of the danger of turning a ceremony into a launch for the programmes and services of   partners  (United Nations, 2010) . Excessive use of commercial adverts at the main arena and  branded   outfits by locals risk defeats the purpose of a traditional ceremony which should be dominated by   traditional paintings, dressings and artistic decorations.    3. CONCLUSION     In this regard, there is great need for political decision -makers and local, national and international   social actors to integrate the principles of traditional ceremonies and the values of cultural pluralism   into all public policies, mechanisms and practices, particularly through public/private partnerships.   This strategy aims, on  the one hand, at incorporating culture into all development policies, be they   related to education, science, communication, health, environment or cultural tourism. On the other   hand, it aims at supporting the development of the cultural sector through cr eative industries. By   contributing in this way to poverty alleviation, culture offers important benefits in terms of social   cohesion.    RECOMMENDATIONS    It is therefore recommended that for traditional ceremonies to contribute to socio – economic   development , there is need to take into consideration the following:  \n",

            "ABSTRACT    HIV infection is a strong predictor of fertility  as it might influence one’s fertility desire. HIV-positive   women may have fertility desires and may intend to have children but these vary by socio -economic,   socio -cultural and demographic characteristics.  Studies of fertility intentions among HIV -positiv e   individuals report a strong desire to have children. With the advent of Antiretroviral Therapy [ART ], the   quality of life for people living with HIV has also been improved potentially impacting fertility intentions   among HIV -infected individuals . However , little is known about their fertility intentions. Thus, this  study   examine s the fertility intentions  and contraceptive use  among HIV -positive women (15 -49 years) in   Zambia.     The analyses are based on women with linkable information on HIV testing, fertil ity preferences and   contraceptive use from the nationally representative 2013 -14 Zambia and Demographic Health Survey    data. HIV data was merged with each woman’s individual file which also contained household variables   to create an analytical file . Analyse s were carried out after merging the HIV test results and women’s file .    Cross -tabulations with Chi -square tests were conducted to ascertain the crude relationship and finally   multiple logistic regressions were employed to identify the major independent pr edictors of fertility   intention using STATA 14.0 with 5% level of significance.    Findings reveal that  out of the total number of women (9,688)  with linkable information on HIV testing   and fertility preferences, 1,654 (17.1%) were HIV -positive. Among the HIV -positive women, a   considerable proportion (46%) still has intentions for having  children in future.  However, the study   findings indicate a  14% significant difference in fertility intention s between HIV -negative (60%) and   HIV-positive (46%)  women . This stu dy has  also found  that majority (58%) of the HIV -positive women   are not contraceptive users . Multivariate analyses reveal ed that HIV -positive  women have lower odds of   wanting more children when compared to their HIV -negative counterparts .    The study has  concluded that  predictors of fertility intentions and use of contraceptive among women are   different by HIV status.  From the findings,  age, education level, marital status and parity were found to be    the major predictors of fertility intentions among HIV -positive women while among the HIV -negatives ;   age, education level, parity, marital status,  employment status, wealth quintile  and region explained their   fertility intentions . Predictors of contraceptive use among  HIV-positive  women include; marital status,   parity, ethnicity, fertility intention, education level and age. The fact that many HIV -infected women   expect to have children has important implications for the prevention of vertical and horizontal   transmission of HIV. There is therefore , the need for comprehensive and continuous expansion of family   planning, voluntary counseling and prevention of mother -to-child transmission (PMTCT) and integration   of HIV treatment care among HIV -positive mothers to meet diverse reproductive intentions.

            "v    ABSTRACT    Accurate determination of weight is essential to avoid drug errors. Where weighing is not   feasible, age or length based formulae are used  to estimate weight. Formulae must be   validated in the local population as most are derived from high income countries where   childhood obesity is increasing.    The “Lusaka formula” was derived from a previously published data set. The study aimed to   validate  this formula in a new data set. Weights, heights and age of 330 children were   measured before surgery. Accuracy was examined by comparing the (1) Mean Percentage   Error and (2) the percentage of actual weights that fell between 10% and 20% of the   estimated  weight for the Lusaka formula and other existing formulae.    The Lusaka formula had a mean percentage error of 1.37% (95% limits of agreement 7.7, -  6.8) and estimated weights to within 10% of actual weight 48.5% of the time. It had a slight   tendency to under estimate weights. Its precision was comparable to the Broselow tape.    No significant difference was found between the sexes with regards to the mean age,   measured weight and estimated weights differences but  regression analysis showed that   maternal educatio n level significantly predicts weight for children above 1 year. Out of the   163 children aged 0 -5 years, 17.8% had under nutrition of varying extents; 3.1% had extreme   malnutrition, 3.1% had severe malnutrition and 11.7% had moderate malnutrition.    The stud y concluded that when actual weight is unknown, the Lusaka formula is superior to   previously published age based weight estimating formulae in children presenting for surgery   at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) in Lusaka, Zambia. Newer formulae signi ficantly   overestimated weights of the children in this population.    Keyword s: Paediatric, weight estimation, low middle -income countries.                    \n",

            "      v    ABSTRACT    Diagnosis of abortion in Zambia relies on clinical findings coupled with ultrasound   examination. The treatment of choice in the first trimester is manual vacuum aspirati on   (MVA). Reducin g the physical pain and anxiety during  MVA is the ultimate goal of   management  for which, several drugs have been  used solely or in combination to try to   alleviate the pain associated with the procedure with variable results. However, the a spect of   anxiety, which is a crucial aspect of care, is not adequately taken care of and perhaps raises   ethical issues around performing MVA under local anaesthesia in emotionally vulnerable   miscarrying women.       A previous  study done at University Teaching H ospital (UTH), Lusaka, Zambia showed that   more than 90% of wome n undergoing MVA experience severe pain, despite receiving   preoperative analgesics such as Paracetamol,  Ibuprofen and Morphine . Ketofol  sedation has   not been tried in MVA in our setting  in spite of successfully producing  adequate sedation   action for many short painful  procedures .   A pre -post interventional study with historical controls was conducted as a quality   improvement study at UTH in the Departme nt of Gynaecology to explore the potential of    Ketofol sedation  to provide adequate sedation and analgesia in women undergoing MVA.    Pain scores were recorded using a Faces Pain Scale during the procedure (reported   immediately after the procedure), at 10 min utes and at 60 minutes. During the procedure,   sedation scor es were determined using Ramsay Sedati on Scale as well measuring heart rate s   and oxygen saturation. Time to discharge was  also measured.        A total of 94 women were studied; 54 patients who received UTH standard care in the   previous study (oral Paracetamol 1g, Ibuprofen 400mg and Morphine 30mg) and 40 patients   who received Ketofol  sedation in addition to the UTH standard care which the patients in the   historical group also received.  Data from 2015 inc luded 54 (57.4%) women who received   UTH standard care (oral Paracetamol, Ibuprofen and Morphine). In the current study Ketofol    sedation was administered in addition to standard care to 40 women during MVA. There was   no statistical difference in all baselin e characteristics of participants in both groups; p value   >0.05. Pain scores were measured during the procedure (reported immediately afterwards),   at 10 minutes and 60 minutes after the procedure. Women in the standard care group   reported significantly hig her pain scores, median 10 (IQR,8 -10) compared to women in the    Ketofol group median 2 (IQR 0 –2); p<0.001 during the procedure, and also reported more   pain at 10 minutes after the procedure however, there was no statistically significant   difference in pain recorded at 60 minutes after the procedure. It was further noted that   patients in the Ketofol  group had significantly lower heart rates during the  proced ure.   addition t o this, it was noted, contrary to expectations, that the time to discharge was reduced   in the Ketofol  group compared to the standard care group, potentially due to reduced pain   experienced .      In conclusion, the results suggest that addition of Ketofol  sedati on to the current UTH   standard of care reduced procedural pain experienced during MVA compared to standard   care alone as well as produc ing effective sedation and rapid recovery.

            "v    ABSTRACT       Inguinal hernias in infants and children a re very common. O ne of the ir most common   complications  before surgery is incarceration, a life threatening condition with potential to   cause severe short term and long term morbidities like bowel ischaemia, testicular atrophy and   its resultant infertility, in futu re. There appears to be, institutional variability in the rates and   risks of inguinal hernia incarceration among infants and children. This study was conducted   with a purpose to determine our own institutional risk of inguinal hernia incarceration among   infants and children awaiting elective surgery. A retrospective review of infants and children   under the age of 17 years, who had undergone inguinal hernia repair or had incarcerated, from   January 2015 to January  2017 was performed. Interviewer completed questionnaires were used   to abstract data from the clinical records. Three hundred and sixty -four patients were included   for analysis, in this study. Descriptive statistics, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Regres sion   Analysis and Kaplan Meiers Survival Analysis were used . The infants and children were   stratified into seven age groups. The incarceration rates and risks were evaluated for each   group. The overall incarcer ation rate was 13.45% . The risk of incarcerati on was age dependent.   It ranged from 0.52 daily risk of incarceration, among neonates, to zero daily risk of   incarceration among older children. Neonates were as high as five times more likely to   incarcerate as  older infants and children. Likewise, younger  children had higher risk of inguinal   hernia incarceration than older ones. Longer wait times were associated with increased rate and   risk of inguinal hernia incarceration. Overall, risk reduction, of inguinal hernia incarceration,   of more than 50% could b e achieved if inguinal hernia repair was done within 14 days of   diagnosis. This study concluded that,  the rate of incarceration was high (13.45%). The risk of   incarceration was age dependent & higher in neonates (0.52), infants & younger children   (0.01). N eonates had as much as 5 times higher risk as other ch ildren . Longer wait times, male   sex, right sided hernias were associa ted with higher rates & risks . Older children had no   incarceration. The best time to operate is before 3 weeks for neonates, before 2  months for   infants & before 4 months for younger children to prevent incarceration .

            "      v    ABSTRACT    Diagnosis of abortion in Zambia relies on clinical findings coupled with ultrasound   examination. The treatment of choice in the first trimester is manual vacuum aspirati on   (MVA). Reducin g the physical pain and anxiety during  MVA is the ultimate goal of   management  for which, several drugs have been  used solely or in combination to try to   alleviate the pain associated with the procedure with variable results. However, the a spect of   anxiety, which is a crucial aspect of care, is not adequately taken care of and perhaps raises   ethical issues around performing MVA under local anaesthesia in emotionally vulnerable   miscarrying women.       A previous  study done at University Teaching H ospital (UTH), Lusaka, Zambia showed that   more than 90% of wome n undergoing MVA experience severe pain, despite receiving   preoperative analgesics such as Paracetamol,  Ibuprofen and Morphine . Ketofol  sedation has   not been tried in MVA in our setting  in spite of successfully producing  adequate sedation   action for many short painful  procedures .   A pre -post interventional study with historical controls was conducted as a quality   improvement study at UTH in the Departme nt of Gynaecology to explore the potential of    Ketofol sedation  to provide adequate sedation and analgesia in women undergoing MVA.    Pain scores were recorded using a Faces Pain Scale during the procedure (reported   immediately after the procedure), at 10 min utes and at 60 minutes. During the procedure,   sedation scor es were determined using Ramsay Sedati on Scale as well measuring heart rate s   and oxygen saturation. Time to discharge was  also measured.        A total of 94 women were studied; 54 patients who received UTH standard care in the   previous study (oral Paracetamol 1g, Ibuprofen 400mg and Morphine 30mg) and 40 patients   who received Ketofol  sedation in addition to the UTH standard care which the patients in the   historical group also received.  Data from 2015 inc luded 54 (57.4%) women who received   UTH standard care (oral Paracetamol, Ibuprofen and Morphine). In the current study Ketofol    sedation was administered in addition to standard care to 40 women during MVA. There was   no statistical difference in all baselin e characteristics of participants in both groups; p value   >0.05. Pain scores were measured during the procedure (reported immediately afterwards),   at 10 minutes and 60 minutes after the procedure. Women in the standard care group   reported significantly hig her pain scores, median 10 (IQR,8 -10) compared to women in the    Ketofol group median 2 (IQR 0 –2); p<0.001 during the procedure, and also reported more   pain at 10 minutes after the procedure however, there was no statistically significant   difference in pain recorded at 60 minutes after the procedure. It was further noted that   patients in the Ketofol  group had significantly lower heart rates during the  proced ure.   addition t o this, it was noted, contrary to expectations, that the time to discharge was reduced   in the Ketofol  group compared to the standard care group, potentially due to reduced pain   experienced .      In conclusion, the results suggest that addition of Ketofol  sedati on to the current UTH   standard of care reduced procedural pain experienced during MVA compared to standard   care alone as well as produc ing effective sedation and rapid recovery.

            "v    ABSTRACT    In 2009, the Zambian government enacted the Public Private Partnership (PPP) Policy   and Act No.14 . The act was aimed at reversing stifled development  across the country   using private financing.    Even with legislation in place, prospective deve lopers often   weigh risks of implementing PPP projects in Africa.  For Zambia, unclear and protracted   negotiation procedures  have tainted the performance of such executed projects .   Consideration of risk allocated to the developer influences decisions made re garding   timely execution of projects. The research aimed to determine critical success factors   and mitigation impacts used in successfully implemented PPP projects. Data gathered on   risk allocation decision -making processes used a mixed research method tha t included   structured interviews, a questionnaire survey and  two case studies . Descriptive analysis,   Rotated Component Matrix and Pearson Correlation Coefficients were used to establish   relationships between independent and dependent variables for allocate d risk.  The   ontological and epistemological philosophical basis of the researcher utilised a   positivistic pragmatic constructionist analytical explanation of the PPP phenomena on   two projects in Zambia. These were University of Zambia East Park Mall develo pment   and the Kasumbalesa Border infrastructure.    The percentage survey response was 46% obtained from 47 analysed questionnaires out   of the 120 that were  administered. Results indicated professionals‟ inability to evaluate   developer‟s risks particularly at  the proposal assessment stage. The PPP contract   outlines risk to the parties involved. Technically, project developers show greater   preparedness during negotiations  in bargaining for their allocated risk . Decisions made,   therefore, were found not to consi st of relevant inputs from areas of risk allocation and   risk mitigation to ensure project success by those evaluating schemes. The research   proposed a  decision -making framework for the timely execution of such  projects in   Zambia. This decision -making frame work would  limit the time of implementing PPP    projects from three to five years to less than  two years and would cover all the phases,   namely; the proposal submission, negotiation, the construction and operation stages.

Some of the challe nges been faced    include: households’ low income s, low elect ricity tariffs, dispersed settlements ,   inadequate funding and centralization of electrical materials among others. The study   also finds that rural households seldom  use electricity for domestic bus iness activities.   Generally, the study finds  the contribution of electrification towards improving rural   standard of li ving through improved livelihoods  negligible. In relation  to households’   access to social goods , the study finds the contribution of elec trification towards   improving households’ standard of living through improved access to healthcare, clean   water and sanitation insignificant.  However, the study finds significant positive impact   of electrification towards improving rural standard of livin g through improved access to   information, communication and entertainment, preservation of foodstuffs and   enhanced  access to education and physical  security of households. Based on the   findings, government through Rural Electrification Authority  (REA)  need  to consider   and promote cheaper  and affordable sources of renewable energy such as Photovoltaic   systems for rural areas . Government should also consider reducing connection charges   for rural households and introduce electricity tariffs that reflect socio -economic status of   rural communities . Furthermore, there is need for government to enhance capacity of   local institutions such as District  Councils in rural areas to accelerate electrification     rate. District  Councils must be involved in the provision an d management of electricity   in rural communities.  There is also need to decentralise operations of REA to rural   District s.

            "vi    ABSTRACT       Live attenuated oral vaccin es against rotavirus have been shown to be less efficacious in children   from developing countries compared to developed countries. Reasons for this disparity are not   fully understood.    This study aimed to investigate the potential association between indic ators of nutritional status   (vitamin A status, weight for age, height for age and mid -upper arm circumference) of the infants   and sero -conversion among Zambian infants routinely immunized with rotavirus vaccine,   Rotarix™.    A total of 1320 infants were asse ssed for enrolment and420 infants were recruited at infant age   6-12 weeks in Lusaka, Zambia. Clinical information and samples were collected at baseline and   at one month following the second dose of rotavirus vaccine. Only 208 infant samples were   analyzed at baseline and one month after vaccination to determine infant nutritional status   (vitamin A status, weight for age, height for age status and mid -upper arm circumference.   Vitamin A status and serum rotavirus -specific IgA were determined using standardize d Enzyme   Linked Immuno -sorbent Assay methods. The anthropometric indices were interpreted using   WHO growth standards. Sero -conversion was defined as a ≥ 4 fold rise in serum IgA titre from   baseline to one -month post Rotarix™ dose 2, while sero -positivity o f IgA was defined as serum   titre ≥ 40. Pearson Chi -squared test was used to investigate the association of sero -conversion   and categorical factors (i.e. sex, vitamin A status, weight for age, height for age, mid -upper arm   circumference at baseline and seru m IgA sero -positivity).    The sero -conversion frequency to rotavirus was 57.2% (119/208) and baseline infant sero -  positivity to rotavirus was 23.1% (48/208). Baseline vitamin A deficiency, underweight and   stunting were 78.9% (164/208), 6.7% (14/208) and 52. 4% (109/208), respectively. Base -line    Infant moderate acute malnutrition was 38.0% (79/208 208) and severe acute malnutrition was   12.50% (26/208) as determined by the infant mid -upper arm circumference. There was no   evidence of association between infant s erum IgA sero -conversion and nutritional variables;   serum vitamin A deficiency (p=0.882), stunting (p=0.905), underweight (p=0.243), Mid -Uper   arm circumference (p=0.565) and infant baseline serum IgA sero -positivity (p=0.832).    Poor IgA sero -conversion fre quency observed in this cohort was not influenced by nutritional   factors indicated by infant serum vitamin A status, weight for age, height for age and mid -upper   arm circumference. Early infant exposure to rotavirus infection, determined by infant serum Ig A   sero-positivity levels did not influence sero -conversions frequencies in this cohort. These factors   may have other effects later in childhood, as no difference was observed among seroconvertors   and non -seroconvertors to rotavirus vaccination in the 6 -12 weeks age group. Further research is   needed to better understand vaccine sero -conversion.          Key word: Rotavirus vaccine, rotavirus, seroconvert, Zambia, Infant        \n",

            "   v    ABSTRACT    The main objective of this study was  to investigate the factors influencing volunt ary   employee turnover in Zambia Airports Corporation Limited  (ZACL) . The sample size of the   study was 255  which included current and former Zambia Airports Corporation Limited   employee’s  employees . The study employed e xplanatory sequential mixed research design .   The data collection ins truments that were employed were  the questionnaire, interview guide    and document review check list . Quantitative data was analyzed using Statistica l Package for   Social Science  (SPSS)  and reinforced with Microsoft excel , while qualitative data was   analyzed using content analysis .    It was found that there were a number of factors that are influenci ng voluntary employee   turnover in ZACL  and these include;  lack of employee recognition, lack of promotion,   recruitment process, leadership style, poor communication, unsatisfactory performance   evaluation, low salaries, lack of training and development, lack of conducive work   environment, lack of effectiv e retention strategies and job location.   The study found that   salary increment, salary market survey and employee satisfaction survey that were being used   by management as retention strategies were not effective. Therefore, the study found that   retention strategies that may help reduce voluntary employee turnover in ZACL are;  right   perso nnel placement into positions, g ood org anization policies, providing c ompetitive   salaries, Training and d evelopmen t, conducive work environment, effective communication,   work-social life balance and use of democratic leadership.    Based on the findings of the study, the following recommendations are made for the Zambia   Airports Corporation Limited:  Management through human resource must hire rig ht   personnel and place them in right positions;  management must providing competitive salaries   to employ ees which are market reflective; t op management should create conducive working   envir onment within the organization and that t op management should involve employees in   the decision making process.  Further research may also  be conducted with a particular focus   on factors influencing departmental transfer as it was also observed that many employees   were changing departments or wished to change their current departments.           \n",

Elements of correlation and narratives were employed to  establish   the relationship between leadership styles and conducive teaching and learning  environments in   colleges of study. Thus, four leadership styles , namely ; autocratic, democratic, laissez -faire and   instructional were investigated to determine the  extent to which they contribute to the  creation of   conducive teaching and learning  environments in colleges. The research engaged 372 participants   randomly  and purposively selected from principals, vice-principals, d irectors, Ministry of   Education officials, staff and students. Data were generated using questionnaires , interviews, focus   group d iscussion, o bservation and  docum ent analysis. Analysis of d ata was guided by positivism   paradigm and phenomenology . Statistica l Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 23   helped to analys e quantitative data whilst qualitative  was analys ed thematically. The Pearson   correlation and Chi square wer e used to assess the significance  levels of the variables  while Path -  goal and Fiedler ’s contingency theories guided the study.    The findings  highlighted  that there was a strong correlation between leadership styles and the   creation of conducive teaching and learning  environmen ts. Secondly , the findings  suggest  that   there was poor to moderate teaching and learning  environmen ts existing in colleges under all the   four leadership styles examined in this study . The statistical combining of these styles also showed   poor to moderate environment with negative implicati ons on teaching and learning . The  findings   further revealed that p rincipals were predominantly using autocratic and  to a small extent   democratic, laissez -faire and instructional  leadership styles which had  repercussions on how   colleges were  run and on crea tion of conducive teaching and learning  environments.  It can ,   therefore, be concluded that the four leadership styles studied have not positively contributed to   creation of conducive teaching and learning environments from the Zambian perspective . This has   repercussions on teaching and learning  taking place in colleges , as it implies that leadership styles   are not universal but their results premise on the context and way the style has been applied.     The study , therefore , recommends  that all principals s hould be  made  aware of the impact of their   style of leadership on teaching and learning . This thesis proposes the usage and adoption of hybrid    leadership style , which requires the blending of masculinity and femininity traits and   understanding of subordinates ’ behavio ur and attitudes in various situations to address the   challenges of leadership being experienced in the colleges . The study has developed the Vision ary   leaders, Dialogue initiator s, Cultural transforme rs, Interpersonal relationship builder s, Transparent   communicator s, and Team builder s and Resource provider  (VDCITTR) framework as  an   innovation to the current leadership styles prevailing in colleges today.  For further study , it is   recommended that research  be conducted  on various colleges  to analyse the suitabi lity of hybrid   leadership style and  the impact the style might have  on training being offered in Colleges  of   Education in Zambia .   Keywords: Conducive environment, leadership styles, teaching and learning .    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS    The successful completion of this thesis would not have been possible without the support,   encouragement and guidance of a host of people I came in contact with at various s tages of my   study.

            "v    ABSTRACT    The study sought to understand the effect on Zambia’s metal export performance of the   geographical patterns of these exports. Particular focus was given to the role of China as a n   anchor of the destination network in terms of external demand shocks. The dimensions   considered were the effect of partner GDP  on metal exports  demand , the respon se of metal   exports  to external demand shocks and the importance of partner GDP growth  correlations in   international trade risk. The Vector Error Correction framework and the Exponential   Generalized Autoregressive Heteroskedasticity model of volatility were employed  using    quarterly data from 1995q1 to 2016q4.  It was found that, in the long  run, partner GDP has a   positive effect on metal exports  demand  while in the short run, metal exports are sensitive to   changes in real effective exchange rate and foreign  (partner) GDP . In addition, metal exporters   in Zambia perceive d external demand shock s due to a network of metal exports destination  as   short run opportunities during the period under study.  The study  further  finds that partner GDP   growth  correlations between China and Zambia’s other metal trading partners were more   important in explaining metal export volatility than individual output volatility in those partners .   However,  this risk tends to manifest itself through volatility in  the  exchange rate and barter   terms of trade . In view of these findings, d iversifying the geography especially through value   addition to metals as well as developing a well -functioning derivatives market  for hedging   against  exchange rate risk due to external demand  shocks  therefore become important   dimensions of policy in Zambia.

            "v    ABSTRACT    This study was aimed at ascertain ing the link between tobacco farming and the factors which   contribute to learner absenteeism in selected primary schools of Nkeyema District . The objectives   were to: analyse the factors which contribute to absenteeism of learners from tobacco and non -  tobacco farming homes in Nkeyema district, find out the stakeholders’ perceived effect of tobacco   farming on primary school learner absenteeism in Nkeyema district and to device measures for   addressing learner absenteeism in Nkeyema district . The study was qualitative in nature and had a   sample of 44 participants who were purposively selected from two primary schools in Nkeyema   District. These participants were selected  from class teachers, lea rners from both tobacco and non -  tobacco farming hom e backgrounds, tobacco and  non-tobacco farming parents from the   communities of the two selected schools. A descriptive design was employed a nd data was   collected using sermi - structured  interviews and focus group discussions. Data was  later analyzed   themat ically. The fin dings of the study revealed that the major factors which contributed to   absenteeism  among learners from both tobacco and non -tobacco farming homes were;  working in   tobacco activities, doing of house chores, long distances from homes to scho ols and lack of   encouragement by parents . The study also found out that tobacco farming had a negative effect on   learner absenteeism in Nkeyema District  in that it exacerbated the problem of long distances from   homes to school through the camp farming syst em, tobacco farming promoted the over dependence   on children to do house chores when parents were busy with farm works. Tobacco farming also   promoted c hild labour. The study suggested some remedies which can be used to reduce lea rner   absenteeism in Nkeyema  District. T hese were; parents to be providing their children with the   educational requirements as a way of motivating them to attend school, sensitize both parents and   their children on the importance of regular scho ol attendance, increase parents - teache rs   collaboration on matters affecting lea rners and that the tobacco farming companies operating in   Nkeyema District should work together with the school administrators to introduce mobile   education program for learners in the tobacco farming camps.       Key wo rds: Absenteeism, Farming,  Learners , Tobacco , Perceptions,  Parents .          \n",

The overall conclusion fro m this study is that, there was a significant   relationship between students‟ confidence levels and their procedural and conceptual   understanding. On this premise, the f indings further indicate that there exists a relationship   between students‟ confidence a nd their actual performance in procedural and conceptual   mathematical problems.  Furthermore, the study revealed that there was a positive correlation   between students‟ understanding of mathematics concepts and their ability to execute   procedures.

            "v    ABSTRACT       Although novel tic k-borne pathogens have emerged to cause severe disease in humans in many   parts of the world, information on tick -borne viruses is scanty in many countries in sub -Saharan   Africa. The Shibuyunji virus, a novel tick -borne phlebovirus (TBPV) was recently  ident ified in   ticks in Zambia. To gain insights into the prevalence, distribution, and genetic diversity of TBPVs   in Zambia, 363 ticks infesting cattle were collected from Namwala and Livingstone districts in   Southern Province and screened for TBPVs  RT-PCR. The  L-gene of TBPVs was detected by PCR   from 19 (5.2%) Rhipicephalus  ticks in Namwala District  and confirmed by  sequence analysis .   Shibuyunji  virus was the only TBPV detected. The detected isolates at the nucleotide, and amino   acid level  shared 92.8 -100% and 98.1-100% similarity, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis   showed that the Shibuyunji  viruses detected in Zambia were closely related to American dog tick   phlebovirus  and formed  a well bootstrap -supported distinct cluster. This study highlights the   possible  role of Rhipicephalus  ticks as the potential  host for the Shibuyunji  virus and that th is virus   may be present outside the area of initial discovery. Furthermore, the study stresses the need for   more studies to be conducted to assess the potential impact o f TBPVs on animal and human health.                 \n",

            "V    Abstract    The study set out to investigate Decentralisation and Quality Education in  Community   schools in Mufulira and Kitwe Districts using Right -Based Approach to education; and    School -Family -Community Partnership Model  by Joyce Epstein. A descriptive survey   approach was used in this research and the sample comprised of 45 community sch ools   drawn from Mufulira and Kitwe districts, 45 head teachers, 100 teachers, 45 Parents   Community School Community Committee, two DEBS (Mufulira and Kitwe), three   officials from Non -Governmental Organisations, namely Zambia Open Community   Schools, the Fle mish Association for Development Cooperation and Technical   Assistance, and United States Aid Time To Learn project. The total sample was 195   participants. The statistical package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was engaged to analyze   quantitative data. Data wer e collected through questionnaires, interview guides, focused   group discussions, observations and document analysis of literature and institutional   records. The findings of the study showed that there were three types of curriculum used   in community school s namely, the Zambian curriculum of 2000, the skills, participation,   Access to Relevant Knowledge curriculum of 1996, and the Revised Curriculum of   2013. The majority of the teachers, that is 89 percent, indicated that they used revised   curriculum of 2013.  An examination of the Grade 7 results from community school   examination centres, for the period 2014 to 2017, showed that the performance of pupils   between those in the studied school and the government schools were similar. The   findings showed that resou rce mobilisation in community schools was a big challenge   because community schools were non -profit making organisations.  Resources were   mobilised mainly from the following: school fees; donations from cooperating partners   especially the United States Age ncy for International Development and The Flemish   Association for Development Cooperation and Technical Assistance; community   contributions; school fundraising ventures and the government. The structure for   resource mobilisation and utilisation was the Par ents Community School committees.   Community schools were monitored and evaluated by Resource Coordinators and senior   teachers of nearby schools. Out of 45 schools, the District Education Standards Officers   monitored only twelve schools. The study showed th at community schools enjoyed   some opportunities in the training of teachers in form of short pedagogical courses   organised by NGOs and cooperating partners through the government. This study found   out that community school pupils enjoyed the flexibility of fered by these schools in   terms of payment of schools fees, and school uniform policy. Administrative challenges   the schools faced were inadequate finances, inadequate infrastructure and learning and   teaching materials, and lack of trained teachers. In con clusion, community schools are   organized and managed by Parents Community School Committees thereby affording   the school managers an opportunity to innovate on activities responsive to their needs.   Monitoring of community schools though crucial to ensuring  quality education was   carried out by non -monitoring and evaluation specialists.        \n",

            "V    ABSTRACT       Background:  Transrectal prostate biopsy is currently the standard technique for   obtaining tissue to make a histological diagnosis of prostate cancer. Infectious   complications after the procedure  can occur despite patients being on antibiotic   prophylaxis. These complications range from being mild to  severe and life -threatening.    Growing evidence attribute s this to the increasing resistance to the commonly used   antimicrobial agents.  The study therefore aimed at evaluat ing the risk factors of urinary   tract infections following prostate biopsy , establish ing the pathogens involved and their   resistance patterns.    Methodology:  This was a prospective cross -sectional study  of a consecutive cohort of   patients who underwent transrectal prostate biopsy at the adult Hospital of the   University Teaching Hospitals  between September 2019 and February 2020. All patients   meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled, demographic and clinical details were   obtained using a questionnaire. Rectal swabs and urine for culture were collected before   the procedure. A second uri ne sample  for culture  was collected one week after the   procedure. Data analysis was conducted using STATA version 13 and results with p -  value less than 0.05 were considered significant.    Results:  Of the 139 patients  who participated in the study, 18 (12.9% ) had a urinary   tract infection after prostate biopsy.  HIV seropositive status was a  significant predictor   for development of UTI after prostate biopsy. Escherichia  coli was the most common   pathogen isolated in the rectal swab (6 3%). In post biopsy  urine, Escherichia  coli was   isolated in 67% (12/18 ) of patients with UTI . Its resistance to the routinely  used   antibiotic (Ciprofloxacin ) was 83% (10/12) and sensitivity to Fosfomycin and   Nitrofurantoin was 100 % and 75% respectively .   Conclusion:  The prevalence of UTIs after tra nsrectal prostate bio psy was 12.9 % and E   coli was the main causative organism . HIV seropositive status, history of having been in   acute urinary retention and paraplegia  were  independent predictor s of UTI after prostate   biopsy.

            "    v    ABSTRACT    This study exp lored the academic experie nces of  blind st udents in two colleges of education in   Zambia. It mainly investigated the nature of student induction programmes offered in colleges of   education , barriers affecting the education of blind s tudents in the two colleges of education  and   avail able suppor t provisions . The study employed an interpretative paradigm, qualitative method   and phenomenological design. Using purposive sampling, a total sam ple of fourteen (14)   participants; eight (8) blind students , four (4) college lecture rs for special  education and two (2)   college administrators were picked for the study. Semi-structured interview guides and   observation checklist s were used  to collect data.  The study established that the nature of   induction  programs offered to first -years students in t he two colleges of education was mainly in   twofold:  actuali sation of students to academic practices and general familiari sation of all students   to the college environment. Although the study established that actuali sation of students to   academic practices enlightened first -year learners to their academic life at the colleges, narratives   of discontentment were equally espoused concerning the inclusivity of the program in relation to   absence of induction handouts in differentiated formats and the inability of  the colleges to   separately familiari se blind students to the college environment and absence of O&M tra ining in   colleges of education.  The most pronounced academic hindrances ex perienced by blind students   were linked to inaccessible and unpredictable coll ege environment, difficulties in securing   sighted guides during blind students ’ stay in the colleges, the dilemmas of repeatedly making   individual follow -up of their written academic work, assessment dilemmas ; lack of assistive   technology and non -existence  of resource rooms.  The study recommended that the two colleges   of education should undertake separate familiari sation programmes for blind students during   first-year induction , Ministry of General Education should institute policy provisions that should   compel colleges of education to provide O&M training to blind students , need for colleges to   improve their physical learning environments and need to promote buddy system approach and   other appropriate support provisions.

            "6    1.3.2  Application of the model to this study    The HBM endeavours to explain and predict health behaviours. This is made possible by focusing   on the attitudes and beliefs of individuals. In this study, the experiences of male partners had a   potential of positively influencing the quality of antenatal c are pregnant women received during the   antenatal period.    The services provided and made available could influence how male partners perceived antenatal   care. According to Rosenstock, 1974, the HBM is based on three assumptions; Firstly, it  assumes    that  a  person  will  take  a  health  related  action  if  that  person feels that a negative health   condition can be avoided. Secondly, there is an assumption that a person will take action if that   person has a positive expectation   and that, by   taking   a   recommended   action,   negative     health condition will be avoided. Lastly it further  assumes  that  a  person  takes  a  health  related    action  if  the person  believes  that  she/  he can  successfully  take  the  recommended action. The    HBM  ha s  six  constructs  as earlier outlined, which  represent  the  perceived  threats and  net   benefits.    a. Perceived severity       In this study, men with pregnant women would realize the susceptibility of their partners to maternal   complications of pregnancy. Therefore, they would realize the consequences of not engaging   themselves in Another  is because in the model,   a   person rec ognizes that she/he is susceptible to a   certain problem, and realizes the serious physical, psychological and social implications that may   follow (Rosenstock, 1974).    b. Perceived benefits    A  person  needs to  believe  that  by  taking  a  certain  action,  it   will  assist  her/him avoid or    prevent  a  problem  from  occurring. It  is  this  belief  which  gives  them confidence  to  take    action  because  they are  sure  of  the  results  (Rosenstock 1974).If men as individuals strongly   believe that involvin g themselves in ANC would enhance the maternal experience of their partners,   it is likely they will engage themselves in ANC and promote wellbeing of their partners.    It was therefore established in this study that male involvement in ANC enhanced the experience of   antenatal mothers . \n",

            "v    Abstract    Inguinal operations are the mos t commonly performed surgeries  in children.  There is a   divergent view on use of pre -operative antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent surgical site infections    (SSI) after these surgeries.  The aim of this study was to detect if the use of cefotaxime had a   significant impact on prevention of SSI in children under 8 years undergoing elec tive i nguinal   surgery at the University Teaching Hospital s, Lusaka.     This was a cohort study. A total of 1 70 patients  below 8 years of age  undergoing elective   inguinal herniotomy, orchidopexy or  patent processus vaginalis  (PPV) ligation  at UTH s were   enrolled . 85 of these  received pre -operative cefotaxime while 8 5 did not receive any antibiotics    based on surgeons preference . A data collection sheet was used to record pre -operative   demographic details. Intraoperative variables and post -operative outcomes. No patient received   post-operative antibiotics. Follow up to  look for Surgical site inf ection  was done at 2 weeks   and 30  days according to  Center for Disease Control  (CDC ) definition of SSI.     Out of 17 0 patients, 11(6.47%) had SSI. Six  of the 85 that received surgical antibiotic   prophylaxis ( SAP) had SSI while 5 of  the 85 that did not receive SAP had SSI (P=0.551). Deep   SSI were seen in 2 patients tha t did not receive SAP (p=0.155) and grew Staphylococcus aureus   in their cultures. Only 1 adverse allergic reaction to preoperative antibiotics was noted.     Despite a lo w risk of adverse reactions, t here is no benefit of using pre -operative antibiotics to   prevent SSI in children undergoing elective inguinal surgery.

            "v    ABSTRACT    The national education curriculum of Zambia’s secondary schools, which follows an Outcome -  Based approach to education, has prioritise d, among other desired competencies , the development   of creative thinking skills in every learner, as the goal of the leaning p rocess. This study aim ed at   reaching an understanding of the extent to which the education process in secondary schools of   Lusaka district is supporting the development of creativ e thinking skills in learners.    In or der to assess creative thinking skills of secondary school learners, this study utilised a   comparative study design under the quantitative approach. Data was collected from a sample of   180 students from six private and public secondary schools within Lusaka district, using the   Torrance T est of Creative Thinking (TTCT) figural form -A.   The findings  of this study  have revealed  that, grade 12 secondary school learners , in both public   and private schools, had lower levels of creative thinking skills. Further , school type was found  to   matter in  the creative thinking  potential of the learner ; as private school learners displayed higher   levels of creative thinking skills than did public school learners. This showed that even though   secondary school students learn  under the same national curriculum , their display  of creative   thinking skills depend s on the kind of immediate environment they are exposed to during their   teaching -learning process. However, the study found that gender  was not a significant factor in   creative thinking potential  of learners  in that boys and girls revealed about the same levels of   creativity.    Based on the findings, this study recommends  that the Ministry of General Education ( MoGE )   through the Curriculum Development Centre (CDC) explore  methods  that will enhance  the   learning process so that it can support  the nurtur ing and development  of creative thinking skills of   the learning in dividual.  In addition, the study recommends that further studies be conducted in   order to find out what is making private school learne rs display better levels of creative thinking   skills than those of public schools.      \n",

            "Abstract  Acommutatively ordered Banach algebra (COBA ) is a complex unital Banach  algebraAcontaining a subset C, called an algebra c-cone , such that Ccontains  the unit of Aand is closed under addition, positive scalar multiplication and  multiplication by commuting positive elements. If the commutativity assumption  is removed, then the resulting cone is called an algebra cone . A Banach algebra  ordered by an algebra cone is called an ordered Banach algebra (OBA ):Evidently,  everyOBA is aCOBA:  Not everyCOBA is however an OBA: An example con\frming this statement is  given by the COBA (B(H);C);whereB(H) is the space of all bounded linear  operators on a Hilbert space Hand  C=fT2B(H) :hTx;xi2R+for allx2Hg:  Benjamin and Mouton described Fredholm theory in OBAs relative to a homo-  morphismT:A!B;whereAandBare Banach algebras, and introduced an  element called an upper Browder element. An upper Browder element x2Ais  an element of the form y+z;whereyis invertible in Aandz2Cis an element  of the null space of Tsuch thatyz=zy:We denote byB+  Tthe set of all upper  Browder elements of A;which in turn gives (in a natural way) rise to the upper  Browder spectrum  \f+  T(x) :=f\u00152C:\u0015e\u0000xis not an upper Browder element g:  In anOBA setting, Benjamin examined the following natural question: given  that the spectral radius of a positive element is not in the Fredholm spectrum of  the element, when will it be outside the upper Browder spectrum of that element?  The element satisfying this condition is said to have the upper Browder spectrum  property (see De\fnition 5.1.1). They went on to show that the connected hulls of  the upper Browder and the Browder spectra do not coincide in general, as well  as the conditions under which the upper Browder spectrum satisfy the spectral  mapping theorem.  In this study we extend these results to COBAs . Since every OBA is aCOBA;  it is actually concluded that some results on upper Browder spectrum of an OBA  element readily extend to COBAs:  For further research, we recommend that the COBAs; rather than the OBAs;  should be the default setting for studying Fredholm theory.  v\n",

            "v    ABSTRACT     Perforated Peptic ulcers (PPU) is one of the common finding in patients undergoing emergency   laparotomy for peritonitis at UTH, Adult Hospital, department of surgery, representing about   26.45% of these cases in a calendar year. A high risk of mortality and morbidity is encountered in   patients treated with surgery for PPU. Patient stratification and appropriate management according   to pat ients risk of mortality, has been recommended as a way of trying to improve outcomes in   patients with PPU. The aim of the study was to investigate the factors associated with mortality in   patients that present with PPU managed surgically at UTH. This was a  prospective cohort study,   conducted at UTH -Adult Hospital, Department of surgery targeting patients with PPU that had   undergone emergency laparotomy.  They were enrolled using interview administered   questionnaire and followed up for 30 -days post -operation . The primary outcome was 30 day post -  operation mortality. The study enrolled 38 participants of which 35 participants met the inclusion   criteria, 88.57% (n=31) male and 11.43% (n=4) female. The age ranged from 14 years to 84 years   with the mode age ranges  20 years – 30 years and 40 years – 50 years. Most patients presented   with two (2) or more complaints. Abdominal pain was common presenting complaint in all the   patients and other complaints included, nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension and   constipat ion. 82.86% (n=29) of the participants presented after 24 hours of onset of symptoms,   17.14% (n=6) were HIV positive and 42.86% (n=15) were in shock on presentation. More than   half of the participants were assessed as ASA score III or greater. On admission  40.00 % (n=14)   had elevated serum creatinine and 37.1 % (n=13) had low serum albumin. 91.43% (n=32) of PPU   were gastric perforations and 8.57 % (n=3) duodenal perforations and the mode and median range   of size of perforation was 5mm – 10mm. Length of hosp ital stay ranged from one(1) day to 13   days with a mean of 7.29 days. 30 -day post -operation mortality was 34.29% and 40% of the   participants developed a post operation complication. Univariate binary regression analysis found   Age, ASA score, Serum creatini ne, and Size of perforation to be significantly associated with   mortality (p -value <0.05, C.I. 95%). Univariate linear regression analysis found HIV positive   Status, and CD4 cell count level to be significantly associated with mortality(p -value <0.05; 95%   C.I.). Multivariate binary regression analysis found no significant association with mortality of the   above variables (p -value <0.05; C.I. 95%). PPU is a common finding among patients with   peritonitis undergoing emergency surgery at UTH and is associated w ith high mortality. Univariate   statistical analysis found Age, ASA score, Serum creatinine, Size of peptic ulcer perforation, HIV   Status and CD4 cell count level to be associated with mortality. However, no factor was found to   be significantly associated w ith mortality on multivariate regression analysis.    KEY WORDS : PPU,  30-Day post -operation  Mortality, Laparotomy              \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT    The purpose of this study was to investigate, compare and contrast the defenc e mechanisms and   strategies used by selected individual characters to cope with racism in Alice Walker’s novel   Meridian and Dominic Mulaisho’s  The Tongue of the Dumb . The study also sought to establish   the significance of the mechanisms and strategies employed in coping with racism with  the ego   defence mechanism theory of psychoanalysis and the stress and coping strategies theory   constituting the t heoretical framework. The study endeavoured  to identify and analyse;   characters that experience and witness  racism in the two texts, the defence mechanisms and   coping strategies used by the characters and the differences and similarities in the mechanisms   and s trategies used. The research was qualitative in nature thus it  employ ed a descriptive   research design,  explanations and interpretations of data were outlined upon analysing racist   cases, instances,  and experiences, defence mechanisms and coping strategies in Meridian  and   The Tongue of the Dumb . Findings were that the selected ch aracters; Lubinda and Merid ian,   employ similar defence mechanisms at times which are; humour, sublimation, passive aggression   and affiliation. The notable differences are that Lubinda also uses identification with the   aggressor while Meridian employs altruism, regression, dissociati on and reactive formation.   Further, both use emotion focused and avoidance focused strategies though Meridian   distinguishes herself  from Lubinda as she also utilis es problem focused strategies. The  findings   show that defence  mechanisms and coping strategie s are crucial in coping with unpleasant or   negative states, feelings and situations. The mechanisms and strategies help the two characters to   avoid, reduce, overcome, challenge and deal with racial prejudice and antagonism thus the   significance of defence mechanisms and coping strategies is manifest . The differences and   similarities demonstrate that defence mechanisms are general, applicable to daily challenges and   that coping is a fluid process and cardinal process.                 \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT    The study aimed at examining key stakeholders' engagemen t with the integration of Environmental   Education (EE) in the Zambian School Curriculum. The objectives of the study were to: determine   actions of key stakeholders towards integration of EE in the curriculum, examine the contribution   of such actions toward s the integration of EE in the school curriculum, assess whether or not key   stakeholders collaborated towards the integration of EE in the school curriculum and suggest best   practices for integrating EE in the school curriculum.    The study used a qualitati ve approach and a descriptive case study design involving three selected   secondary schools of Chilanga district was employed. The target population was the University of   Zambia (UNZA), Ministry of Water Development, Sanitation and Environmental Protection   (MoWDSEP), Ministry of General Education (MoGE), Curriculum Development Centre (CDC)   officials, secondary school managers and teachers.    Purposive sampling was used to select the respondents. Data was collected using semi structured   interviews, focus group discussions and non - participant observations. Data was analyzed using   thematic analysis and validated using in between method of triangulation.     Results showed that key stakeholders were involved in a number of actions towards the integration   of EE in th e curriculum. The contribution of most of such actions was however, found to be limited   mainly due to underutilization. With regards to collaboration, the study found that stakeholders’   collaboration towards EE was poor. Stakeholders merely informed each o ther most of the times   and did not truly involve or engage with each other.    In conclusion, the study showed that stakeholders’ engagement towards EE integration in the   Zambian school curriculum was poor. Based on these findings, it was recommended that key    stakeholders needed to engage in monitoring and evaluation of EE and in developing an effective   communication strategy to ensure that actions were fully utilized and collaboration enhanced   respectively.     Keywords: Environmental Education, collaboration a nd stakeholder engagement.     \n",

            "     vi    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS    This thesis culminates from a long journey of study at  the Department of Development   Studies at the University of Zambia. Indeed, a long journey punctuated with occasional   detours and seemingly insurmountable challenges. Despite  the challenges, the journey   was worth the while. I am deeply indebted to many peo ple and organisations that   contributed to and supported the accomplishment of this work. For a thesis to become   the thesis, there is usually someone guiding the work. First and foremost, to my   Supervisor Professor Thomson Kalinda, I am highly grateful for your thorough advice   and patience in awaiting for the chapters. Without your support and sound advice there   would have been no thesis to talk about!  I also pay special gratitude to my first   Supervisor the late Dr. Bennett Siamwiza. You were such a pillar during the formative   stage of this study but the spectre of death robbed me a supervisor in you.    This thesis benefited from two main academic projects. The thesis is a result of the   research carried out under the DfID funded Land and Agricultural Commercia lisation   in Africa (LACA) Project hosted at the Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies   (PLAAS) at University of the Western Cape, under the auspices of the Future   Agricultures Consortium. I am grateful to Professor Ruth Hall, the Coordinator of t he   LACA Project for accommodating my study in the project. Special thanks to Professor   Ian Scoones co -principal investigator under the LACA project for his initial advice to   this thesis. Professor Dzodzi Tsikata also co -principal investigator under the LAC A   project gave a valuable critique to the project material that also was of much help to this   thesis.    The thesis also benefitted from the Finnish Foreign Affairs Ministry funded project -   Higher Education Institutions Institutional Cooperation Instrument ( HEI ICI):   Developing Development Studies (2011 – 2016) involving the Department of   Development Studies at the University of Zambia, Institute of Development Studies at   the University of Dar es Salaam, Institute of Development Studies at the University of   Helsinki and Department for International Cooperation and Philosophy at the University   of Jyvaskyla. The HEI -ICI project involved largely skills development for academic   staff who were enrolled for PhD studies in their respective universities. I am grateful  for   the small grant towards this thesis from HEI -ICI. I would like to acknowledge Professor   Jeremy Go uld, Dr. Aldagot Komba, Professor Elina Oinas, Dr. Tiina Kontinen, Dr. \n",

            "6    (UNDP Governance Policy, 1997).  On the other hand, according to the former World   Bank president Barber Conable (1986), good governan ce refers to “as a public service   that is efficient, a judicial system that is reliab le and an administration that is accountable   to its public. Conversely, bad or poor governance  is characterized by arbitrary policy   making, unaccountable bureaucracies and legal syste m, abuse of public office and wide   spread corruption.    It is also important to understand the conceptual d istinction between good   governance and liberal democracy as the two terms h ave been used interchangeably.   Good governance as earlier defined implies effectiv e management of public affairs where   as liberal democracy simply means free and fair par ticipation in public affairs. According   to Danziger (2005), liberal democracy constitutes e xtensive political and civil liberties   regarding participation, personal freedoms and oppo sition. It is normally characterised by   free and fair elections, upholding of human rights and rule of law. In this regard, there is   a strong relationship between good governance and l iberal democracy. That is for   effective management of public resources (good gove rnance) to be realised, people’s   freedoms and rights (liberal democracy) should be o bserved to allow their views to be   taken in the governance agenda. Therefore good gove rnance can only be archived if   people participate in their governance process full y through their rights and duties. In   most cases, multilateral institutions promote good governance alongside liberal   democracy as a basis for sustainable development. S ustainable development basically   entails utilization of a country’s scarce resources  to meet basic needs. According to the   Report of the World Commission on Environment and D evelopment (1987) entitled “Our   Common Future,” sustainable development is developm ent that meets the needs of the   present without compromising the ability of the fut ure generations to meet their own   needs. It involves improved living standards for al l, better protected and managed   ecosystem and a safer, more prosperous future.    The above understanding of sustainable development is the one that has been   embraced by multilateral institutions in the promot ion of good governance. Multilateral   institutions are organizations formed by a group of  nations to work on issues that affect   the member countries. These include political, econ omic and social issues.  For these   issues to be addressed adequately in any country, m ultilateral institutions believe that \n",

            "      iv        ABSTRACT        Children with multiple measures of anthropometric failure are at a high risk of   morbidity and mortality as a result of malnutrition. Some of the factors that contribute   to the high levels of malnutrition which is described in forms of stunting, underweight  ,   overweight and wasting in children   6  -  23 months   include poor infant stimulation and   nurturing, inadequate dietary nutrients and recurrent   illnesses/  infections     which     result   in poor absorption of nutrients, poor cognitive development, growth failure and wei  ght   loss. The  se     factors are common in developing countries such as Zambia where only   11% of children in this age group are fed appropr  iately according to   WHO   recommendations. Based on this background, this   cross sectional   study   was done with   the aim of   inv  estigating the   association between     dietary intake  ,   prevalence of   illnesses   and     nutritional status of   children aged 6  -  23 months in Namwala and Mkushi     districts   of Zambia  . A total of 213 children were enrolled, 108 and 105 from Namwala and   Mkushi  ,     respective  ly. A detailed questionnaire, anthropometric assessment as well as   a complete stool analysis was done. Ant  hropometric, dietary intake,     socioeconomic   and demographic data collected was analysed using Anthroplus, NutriSurvey and   SPSS version 23 software  ,     res  pectively.   The study revealed that none of the children   were infected with intestinal parasites. However, 65.7% of the children presented with   an illness two wee  ks prior and/or     during the study.   Illnesses   identified   in the study   group included fever,   diarrhoea, vomiting and coughs.     In the two sites combined, 5.2  %   of the children did not meet the minimum dietary     diversity requirements for this age   group.   Overall in Namwala district, the prevalence of stunting was 11%, 3  .7% wasting,   3.7% underweight, 6.5  % overweight while Mkush  i district had 19% stunting, 3.8  %   wastin  g, 10.5% underweight and 5.7  % overweight among children aged 6  -  23 months.   The mean   H  eight  -  for  -  a  ge   Z     s  cores between Namwala (  -  0.51 ± 1.40) and Mkushi (  -  1.04 ±     0.95)   were   significantly different     (t  0.05     3.245  ).     Using multiple regression, the   variables independently associated with   HAZ scores     in this study are   child’s age   (months), household non  -  food expenditure and consumption of   mabisi     (fermented   milk)  .     Health status   was not significantly   associated with nutritional status while   dietary diversity showed a weak positive association with child nutritional status.      \n",

            "      vi     ABSTRACT       Pneumonia in sickle cell disease (SCD) can be particularly severe and has come to be called   acute chest syndrome  (ACS). ACS is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease in patients   hospitalized with vaso -occlusive crisis (VOC). It is associated with a high risk of sickle cell -  related mortality and morbidity in children, including prol onged hospitalization. The aims of   this study were  to determine the prevalence of pneumonia in sickle cell disease,  and also to   determine  cells that are mostly associated with pneumonia in si ckle cell disease. Furthermore,   were  to determine outcomes of pne umonia in SCD and pneumonia for under -five children   referred to University Teaching Hospital.       The study employed a  cross -sectional design, using secondary dataset  from paediatrics wing   within University Teaching Hospital. Complete enumeration was applied.    Continuous data were summarised by means and standard deviation while frequencies and   percentages were used for categorical data. The data was analysed using  STATA version 13.0   (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).  Logistic regression was applied to assess   associations of study variables.    A total of 601 under -five children with pneumonia was studied for their pneumonia in SCD.   Out of 601 under -five children,  84 had pneumonia in SCD, while 517 had pneumonia  only.   The under -five children comprised of 53% (n=317)  males and 47% (n=284) females, their   ages ranged from 28 days to 59 months  years old,  with a mean age (±SD) of 2.8 ± 1.4 months   years old. The prevalence of pneumonia in sickle cell disease was 14% . Mortality for    pneumonia in SCD was 12.8% (n=15) while in pneumonia only was  87.2% (n=102).   Furthermore we established haemoglobin, red blood cells, white blood cells, mean cell   haemoglobin and monocytes as cells that are mostly associated with pneumonia in SCD.       The study achieved its set objectives, by determining pneumonia in SCD  prevalence,   haematological parameters which are mostly associated with  pneumonia in  SCD , and the   outcomes of pneumonia in SCD . Therefore,  the government through the Ministry of Health   and other partners need to formulate policies towards the reduction of pneumonia in sickle   cell disease burden in Zambia.

            "v    ABSTRACT    Social studies is aimed and intended at developing good and ideal citizens, who have an   understanding of the society they live in. It has also  been identified as a subject within the   school curriculum that is used as a vehicle for equipping learners with the requisite   knowledge, skills, values, attitudes and dispositions relevant for producing functional and   effective citizens. The purp ose of this study was to investigate  the challenges faced in   teaching and learning of Social Studies in selected primary schools in Lusaka District of   Zambia. The objectives of the study were; to explore the challenges faced in the teaching   and learning of Social Studies, to establish the method s used in the teaching and learning of   Social Studies, to ascertain the benefits of teaching and learning of Social Studies in primary   schools and to suggest solutions to the challenges faced in the teaching and learning of   social studies in primary school s. This study used a descriptive  research design which   employed a  qualitative strategy in order to effectively address the issues raised by the   research questions. The target  population was the CDC Social S tudies Specialists, Head   Teachers, Teachers and Le arners. The total sample size was 39 which comprised of 3 CDC   Social Studies specialists, 3 Head Teachers, 12 Teachers and 21 Learners. Purposive   sampling technique; in particular, homogenous sampling was used to select respondents .   The data collection ins truments used were semi structured interview guide, observation   checklist and document analysis whose findings were analyzed thematically.  The findings   revealed that there were enormous challenges faced in the teaching and learning of social   studies includ ing; multi discipline and diverse in nature , limited training, shortage of highly   skilled human resource, ra dical transformation in the  field, increasing social inequalities,   diversification of the economy, teacher qualification, teachers  using wrong teac hing   methods, access and quality, cultural differences, wastage and stagnation, absenteeism, poor   teacher to pupil ratio, teachers  not  being involved in curriculum development, negative   attitude by both the teachers and the learners, teachers not underst and the aims, purpose and   goals of social studies, less time allocation on the timetable  and learners not having access   to educational  tours. Social S tudies also do not receive vigorous support as a vital part of the   school curriculum and that schools lac ked teaching and learning materials.  Although, there   were recommended methods for teaching and learning social studies, teachers still used   wrong methods and did not democratize these methods during lesson presentation. However,   if taught well, social stud ies have a lot of benefits to the learners. It was therefore   recommended that both teachers and learners are sensitized, motivated and supported on the   importance of Social Studies. Teachers as implementers should be involved in the process of   curriculum d evelopment. Educational tours and site visits should be made a must for   particular topics. Primary schools should be provided with adequate materials   (infrastructure, text books etc.) to ease some of the challenges they face in teaching and   learning of soc ial studies.

            "      v     ABSTRACT    The study assessed the contributions of the curriculum to the socio -economic life of school   leavers with visual impairme nt in Ndola district, Zambia. The objectives that guided this   study were: to establish the nature of socio -economic life of school leavers with   impairment; to assess factors surrounding socio -economic life of school leavers with visual   impairment and to ex plore the contributions (if any) of the curriculum to socio -economic   life of school leavers with visual impairment in the study district. The study employed a   case study research design supported by qualitative methods of data collection in order to   get in -depth information. A sample size of 26 participants consisting: 12 school leavers   with visual impairment, one Head teacher, 10 grade teachers of learners with visual   impairment, one Education Standards Officer (ESO), one Senior Education Standard   Officer (SESO) and one Curriculum Specialist for visual impairment from the Curriculum   Development Centre (CDC). The participants were purposively selected for the study. Data   was collected using interview and Focus Group Discussion Guides. Data analysis was done   using thematic analysis method.  The study revealed that although learners with visual   impairment used the same curriculum as the sighted in the main stream, it was too   theoretical and not quite relevant to the prevailing socio -economic detects in the stud y   district. The curriculum did not make significant contribution to the socio -economic life of   school leavers with visual impairment in the study area in that they continued to live in   poverty. The study further revealed that school leavers with visual imp airment continued to   depend on odd socio -economic activities such as begging in streets and heavy dependence   on their relatives for daily livelihood which was indicative of inadequacies in the   curriculum they were once exposed to. The inadequacies in the c urriculum, in relation to   socio -economic life of school leavers with visual impairment were attributed to: shortage of   qualified and specialist teachers; lack of pre -vocational skills content in the curriculum,   limited learning materials and equipment to s upport practical skill pre -vocational training;   inappropriate skills assessment process and lack of a clear linkage between school,   vocational and tertiary education curriculum. The study recommended the following:   prioritising pre -vocational skills traini ng in the curriculum for a possible uplifting of the   socio -economic lives of the would be school leavers in the study district, employing   qualified teachers specifically for training programmes associated with pre - and vocational   training activities, to ha ndle vocational skills related areas. Promote collaboration among   various stakeholders such as line ministries; churches; communities and Non -  Governmental organisations.

            "v    ABSTRACT    Solid waste management is a large and growing problem for countries in the developing world and   is often a neglected aspect of urban management. Poor waste management can contribute to the   impact of urban flooding by blocking drainages and increasing debris. However, information is   lacking on the link  between solid waste management and floods in the city of Lusaka, Zambia . It   was for this reason that this study sought to establish how the indiscriminate disposal of waste   contributes to urban flooding. Specifically, the study sought to identify the type s of solid waste   produced by the residents in Kalikiliki and Kanyama Ward 10 settlements, investigate how solid   waste is disposed of by households and find out challenges faced by residents in disposing of solid   waste.  A total of 505 questionnaires were ad ministe red to any adult present at each  particular   household. This included 200 from Kalikiliki and 305 from Kanyama Ward 10. Semi -structured   interviews were conducted with 20 key informants from relevant institutions and observations   were also made. The r esults of the study indicate that the types of domestic solid wastes generated   in the study areas were mainly organic, paper, plastic, old and rusted metals, diapers and textile   wastes. The study was able to confirm and map points in the two settlements wh ere waste   contributes to flooding.  The study also confirmed that waste collection franchise  is inadequate in   Kalikiliki and Kanyama Ward 10 settlements. This was easily identified by persistent heaps of   uncollected waste found on ubiquitous illegal dumps. Therefore, residents in the two settlements   resort to unsafe and unsustainable waste disposal practices such as burning, burying  and open   dumping, which contribute to blockage of drainages. On the challenges faced on solid waste   disposal, it was revealed t hat residents of the two settlements have no designated damping places.   The study further revealed that residents’ perceptions indicate that means of solid waste   management contribute to the f looding in the study areas . The research concluded that open   dumping and depositing of waste in uncontrolled and unauthorized locations contribute to   increased flood events.  Based on the findings, the study therefore recommends that  Ministry of   local government and rural development through LCC should provide waste rec eptacles in large   quantities and place them at intervals of not more than 200 metres apart in both settlements and   even commercial areas.

            "v    ABSTRACT       The Ministry of General Education introduced the Primary Language Policy (PLP) in   the 2013 revised curriculum framework that promotes the use of a familiar language in   the lower grades (1 -4) with a view to ad dress  the low reading levels among learners in   the lower grades as established by most researchers in the country. However, although   most research has revealed that the use of familiar language enhances the development   of emergent literacy skills among learners  in the lower grades, there is no empirical   evidence that the use of familiar language enhances literacy to learners with   intellectual disabilities. Based on this premise, this study sought to investigate the   reading levels of learners with intellectual di sabilities with the goal of examining the   extent to which the use of familiar language has addressed reading skills of learners   with Intellectual Disabilities and if not, to suggest effective strategies. The study was a   longitudinal design, conducted from 2018 September to 2019 September. The goal of   a longitudinal design was to track the changes and progression of the learners since the   same sample was repeatedly studied. This repeated study on the learners helped to   establish the cause effect of teaching reading in a familiar language.  Qualitative  and   quantitative research methods were used.  A mixed  research method was thought   befitting in the sense that it captures  both the ontological and epistemological   assumption to the study. The belief and value  of this triangulation is that knowledge is   a social construct and as such, the use of the familiar language which is used in social   interactions is perceived to enhance the acquisition of reading skills when learners are   taught in a language they are  familiar with.   Considering the research objective and the   theoretical frame work, a constructivism/interpretivism philosophical assumption was   the underpinning of this research.  The belief is that knowledge is created through   social interaction  and inter preted by people and experienced by people through their   interactions with each other . The  conceptual frame work of the  social cultural   influence on learning,  guided the study.

Many people have   argued that caring for such a group of patients  is followed with unique challenges. Despite the   information  about caring for patients suffering from mental ill ness, little  information is available   and known about lived experiences of caregivers at filter clinic coming for reviews and admitted   in wards at Chainama Hills Hospital Lusaka Zambia,  worse in the community where such cases   are occur .This study deals with an exploration of caregives ’ experiences of physical violence   from discharged mentally ill patients at Chainama Hills Hospital.The purpose is to explore the   aggressiveness of violent behavior by discharged mentally ill patients from Chainama Hills   Hospital towards the caregivers.    This study’ objective  is to discover and describe the lived experiences of caregivers who care for   mentally ill patient at home but attending reviews at Chainama hills Hospital Lusaka Zambia.    The study employed a descriptive s urvey design in which qualitative techniques, phenomelogical   were used to conduct the research and collect the required data.

            "iv    ABSTRACT       The teaching and learning of Civic Education helps learners recognize the profound   role that the subject plays in society. Numerous studies have been done on factors that   influence learning  in various subjects, but there seemed to be no study which examine d   the use of reflective teaching approaches in Civic Education lessons in secondary   schools in Zambia. This study sought to investigate the use of reflective teaching   approaches in Civic Education lessons in selected secondary schools in Lusaka   District.    The objectives of the study were to: Identify Reflective Teaching approaches used by   teachers in Civic Education lessons, establish benefits of using the Reflective Teaching   approaches in Civic Education lessons, identify challenges associated with the use  of   Reflective Teaching approaches in Civic Education lessons, and determine measures   that can be put in place to curb the challenges arising from the use of Reflective   Teaching approaches in Civic Education lessons. The study was guided by a   qualitative a pproach and the research strategy used was a descriptive design. Data was   collected using a reflective questionnaire and lesson observation checklist. Purposive   sampling was used to identify the participants in the study.  The participants included   6 deput y head teachers, 6 Civic Education heads of section, 6 social sciences heads of   department and 18 Civic Education teachers. The total number of the participants in   the study amounted to 36.    The findings of this  study established that: continuous professio nal development   (CPD), peer observation, role play, action research, demonstration, home -work and   class exercises were some of the forms of reflective teaching used in Civic E ducation   lessons. The findings  further revealed that time allocation, large numbe rs in classes,   lack of participation from learners were inhibiting reflective teaching in Civic   Education lessons. It was also discovered that reflective teaching trigger critical   thinking in the learners and it makes teachers to be aware of the learning n eeds of their   students. Based on the findings outlined above, this study concludes that the teaching   and learning of Civic Education can only improve if teachers are to pay attention to   reflective teaching approaches. If teachers do not improve on the use of reflective   teaching approaches, the goals and aims of Civic Education will not be realised and   the learners too will not become innovative and critical thinkers once t hey are out of   school. The researcher  recommended that secondary school authorities sh ould   implement the use of reflective teaching in all Civic Education lessons.    Key words: Reflective teaching, Forms of Reflective Teaching, Civic Education                    \n",

            "     v    ABSTRACT    Accurate measurement of body fat mass (BFM) is critical in assessing o verweight and obesity that   pause health implications of other non -communicable diseases (NCDs). The traditional commonly   used method, body mass index (BMI) is not adequate to measure BFM because  it does not account   for body composition. Hence t he study measur ed BFM and free fat mass (FFM) using bioelectrical   impedance analysis (BIA) in relation to BMI. This allowed for better estimation of human   nutritional status and determ ination of misclassification when BMI method is used alone.       A total of 247 participants, comprising 54% females and 46%males aged 18 -55 years were selected   from University of Zambia (UNZA), Chalimbana University (CHAU), Natural Resources   Development Colle ge (NRDC) and Chongwe College of Education (CCE). Participants were   further categorized into young adults aged 18 -39 years (77%) and old adults aged 40 -55 y ears   (23%). Both m easurements  of BMI and BIA  were taken in the morning following overnight fasting    Statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) was used to analyze data. Descriptive statistics were   used to characterize participants while inferential statistics applied a 95% confidence int erval (CI).   Results showed Pearson correlation BMI and BFM (r=0.6 60), age BMI (r=0.372) and BFM   (r=0.273), sex BMI (r= -0.273), and BFM (r= -676). The ANOVA and t -test associations for all   parameters gave p<0.001.  Age regression (coefficient =0.372 BMI; 0.273 BFM, p< 0.001) and sex   effect (coefficient= -0.273 BMI; -0.676 BFM, p< 0.001) .Cross tabulation of World Health   Organization (WHO) cut offs for BMI against BFM r eviewed a difference of 82.2%.    In all categories BFM values were higher than BMI and differences were significant (p<0.001),   though correlated positively ( r=0.660). As BMI increased BFM also increased. Both age and sex   indicated significant influence on BMI and BFM whilst the correlation reflected positive for age   and negati ve for sex.    This study showed that BMI in relation to BIA underestimates BFM  if used as a proxy  which leads   to misclassification of nutritional status. Increase in age translated into increased BMI and BFM.   Lower BMI and BFM values were observed in men in relation to females and increased BMI and   BFM in old adults in comparison with young adults. Thus BIA can be used to supplement BMI in   diagnosis and management of problems associated with overweight and obesity .

            "v    ABSTRACT    The purpose of this study was to explore functional  literacy related challenges faced by women   entrepreneurs in Lusaka district. The objectives of the study were to: i dentify functional literacy   programmes (FLPs) for women entrepreneurs available in Lusaka district; determine how   women entrepreneurs partic ipate in functional literacy programmes offered in Lusaka district;   establish functional literacy -related challenges faced by women entrepreneurs in Lusaka district;   and propose strategies that can address functional literacy related challenges faced by wo men   entrepreneurs in Lusaka district. A descriptive research design was employed. A sample of 65   respondents was used comprising 50 women entrepreneurs and 15 officers from non -  governmental organizations (NGOs). Interview guides and observation checklists were used for   data collection. The study revealed that functional literacy programmes available in Lusaka   district included skills development, educational literacy and awareness literacy. Other   programmes included financial and accounting training as well  as survival skills. It also revealed   that participation of women in functional related programmes was low despite the NGOs   respondents indicating a high participation of women entrepreneurs in their programmes. The   study also indicted that challenges face d by women entrepreneurs included inadequate funding,   lack of business information, low business returns, competition, poor record keeping, inadequate   selling space, and lack of supportive materials . Proposed strategies aimed at addressing these   challenges  included creating favourable lending rates by banks, creation of market places and   providing women empowerment programmes.  The study recommended that: t he government   should increase the number of functional Literacy programmes to encourage more women to   participate; NGOs should come up with better and efficient ways of reaching women and make   their programmes attractive so as to encourage high participation; government should invest   more in public infrastructure such as schools and markets to provide most  women with literacy   and better trading places; the government should consider creating a special revolving fund that   can be accessed by women entrepreneurs to help with their capital needs.    Key words:  Functional literacy, Entrepreneurship, women.        \n",

            "    v    ABSTRACT       Zambia is among the most urbanized countries in Sub -Saharan Africa and is faced with   urban development challenges in the provision of basic infrastructure such as water and   sanitation to an ever -increasing urban population. Lusaka has over the years undergone a   rapid urban expansion in the growth of reside ntial areas without a corresponding expansion   in the provision of water and sanitation. The study is aimed at analysing the nature of   challenges faced in the provision of water and sanitation services in newly planned   residential areas in Lusaka. The study  sought to assess the nature of water and sanitation   provision in Kwamwena Valley, challenges faced by the residents in accessing water as   well as the challenges faced by the residents in accessing sanitation services in the area.   The study was based on da ta collected from 120 household questionnaires conveniently   sampled and supplemented by seven key informants purposively selected from institutions   with a stake in water and sanitation. The results obtained show that there is on -site   provision of water and  sanitation in Kwamwena valley. For water provision, the results   indicated that the main sources of water for the residents are private boreholes with   elevated tanks and submersible pumps (58.3 percent), hand pumps (20 percent), communal   taps (3.3 percent)  and shallow wells (3.3 percent) while others did not have onsite water   (13.6 percent). For sanitation, results indicated that the main sanitation facilities included   pit latrines which accounted for 45 percent, flush toilets 35 percent and Ventilated   Impr oved Pit -latrines (VIP) toilets at 20 percent. Out of 120 households interviewed, 56.7   percent of the residents reported that they faced challenges in accessing water while 43.3   percent did not, and the main challenges included costs of installing borehole s and drawing   water among others. For sanitation, results showed that the main challenges faced are septic   tanks filling up within short periods, the cost and poor pit latrine emptying services, poor   construction of pit -latrines among other things.  This st udy concludes that the inadequacy   in the provision of water and sanitation by LWSC given the population increase and growth   of new settlements leads to on -site provision of water and sanitation by residents. This is   however unsustainable and may cause both  environmental and health problems due to the   increase in the number of boreholes drilled and septic tanks built. As such there is need to   come up with a more sustainable way of providing these service to residents as areas are   planned .

            "v    ABSTRACT    The S urgical Apgar Score (SAS) is a very easy and objective tool for triaging patients post -  surgery. It can be used as an assessment tool for performance of hospitals, units or individual   surgeons. However, not much research has been done to assess its utility in resource limited   settin gs like Zambia. This study was undertaken  to assess the predictability of SAS in   laparotomy patients at UTH  in Lusaka, Zambia. This was a prospective cohort study. A total of   50 patients  were recruited , their intraoperative data collected and SAS cal culated . The patients   were followed up for 30 days. The primary end point was incidence of any major complication   and/or death as defined by the Dindo -Clavien classification . Two out of the 50 patients enrolled   were lost to follow up, leaving a total of 48 patien ts.  Age ranged from 17 to 89 years with mean   age of 38.8 years (SD 17 years). Out of the patients enrolled, 79 percent were male with 73   percent of operations being emergencies. Intestinal obstruction was the most common diagnosis   accounting for 31.3 perc ent followed by viscus perforation. Of the patients enrolled, 58.3 percent    had no complications. Overall, complications rate was 41.3  percent  which was consistent with   published literature. Deep surgical site infection was  the m ost common complications at 12.5   percent . Patients who did not develop complications had a  significantly higher SAS compared to   patients who did  (p<0.001). Mortality rate in the high risk group was higher than predicted by   SAS (p=0.23). Period of operation and gender did not signific antly affect the SAS of patients  (p   values =0.45 and 0.28 respectively).    This study confirms that SAS is adequate at predicting outco me in laparotomy patients in   resource limited settings like UTH.

            "v    Acknowledgements    This dissertation would not have yielded the desired results if it had not been for the   unwavering support of my supervisor, Dr. Clarence Chongo. Despite occupying a busy office of   Assistant Dean, Postgraduate Studies in the School of Humanities and Social  Sciences and at the   same time working as a lecturer, Dr Chongo worked tirelessly to see to it that all the chapters   were thoroughly checked in good time. This indeed posed a reciprocal challenge on me to work   extra harder. He did not only criticis e me but  endeavoured to inspire me to forge ahead   irrespective of whatever bottlenecks I encountered on the way to producing this work. For the   concerted efforts demonstrated on this dissertation, I wish to sincerely express my gratitude to   him.   Special thanks als o go to some scientists who helped to shape my study through   consultation. These are Professor Keith Mbata and Professor Philip Nkunika both of the   Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Zambia.  Given the nature of this study   and although i t was written from the historical perspective, it immensely benefitted from the   experts in entomology who shared relevant scientific knowledge about edible caterpillars.     These senior lecturers therefore deserve a pat at their backs for willingly acceptin g „too many‟   questions I posed to them. For their support, I am heavily indebted.    My utmost appreciation goes to some institutions and individuals whom I interv iewed   during data collection.  Of these interviewees the following ought to be mentioned: Fr. Justine   Chomba, Fr. Oscar Chishimba, Mr. Gabriel Chambeshi, Mr. Paul Kasonje, Mr. Mwe wa Chibwe,   Mr. Robinson Mulenga and  Mrs Precious Nganga .

            "5    ABSTRACT    Epilepsy is a disorder caused by many factors, including infection of the central nervous system   with the larval stage of Taenia solium, leading to neurocysticercosis (NCC). People with   epilepsy (PWE) in  low-income countries often do not receive appropriate treatment, which   besides the continuing epileptic seizures, may also lead to cognitive impairment, reduced quality   of life, stigma, injuries, and possibly death. The objective of this study was to desc ribe gaps in   epilepsy management in a T. solium endemic rural area of Zambia .    A cross -sectional study was conducted in Sinda district of the Eastern Province of Zambia   between August and October 2018. PWE identified from clinic records including PWE from a   previous study were re -contacted. PWE not recorded in the clinic records, but with a reported   history of epileptic seizures by community members were also included. Serum and stool   samples of PWE were collected and tested for cysticercosis and taeniosis  respectively. Two   questionnaires were administered, one to PWE and one to local healthcare providers  to describe   management for epilepsy, the reasons for non -treatment as well as, non -adherence to treatment,   and the associated risk factors.    A total of 146 PWE and 43 healthcare providers  were interviewed. Sixteen of the PWE were   diagnosed with definite NCC in a previous study . Samples were tested for 129 PWE out of the   130 who had never been diagnosed with NCC, and thereof 36  were diagnosed wi th probable   NCC following the Del Brutto diagnostic criteria . Forty -four percent of PWE were on anti -  epileptic drugs, however, only 26 (17.8%) were on regular anti -epileptic treatment, resulting in a   treatment gap of more than 82%. O ver 50% of healthcare providers  did not know the relationship   between epilepsy and NCC. The risk factors associated with lack of correct treatment were   stock -outs of anti -epileptic drugs, long distance to health facilities, lack of diagnostic equipment   and poor patient follow up , and PWE opting for traditional medicine .   The results of this study demonstrated that gaps in the management of epilepsy in PWE and NCC   are substantial  in Sinda district.  The causes are multifactorial, involving shortcomings on the   level of the health fac ilities, communities, and individuals. Significant improvements in the   supply and dispensing of anti -epileptic drugs, accompanied by closer monitoring and follow -ups   of PWE may be key in substantially reducing the management gap and subsequently address th e   challenges and suffering of PWE.  \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT    The purpose of this study was to explore  the application of adult learning principles by  District   Election Trainers in s elected Constituencies of Lusaka District. The study was guid ed by the   followi ng objectives : (i) to describe how District Election Trainers apply adult learning   princ iples when training poll staff .  (ii) to identify  challenges faced by District Election Trainers   in the application of  adult learning princ iples when training poll staf f, and (iii) to explore District   Election Trainers  suggested  possible solutions on how  adult learning principles  can be applied    when training poll staff . The study employed a case study design with a qualitative approach.   The study population comprised  all District Election Trainers who participated in the 2016   election training in  Lusaka District  whose number was 180 . Purposiv e sampling was used to   select 4 5 District Election Trainers from the four selected constituencies of Lusaka District. A   semi-structu red interview guide  and a questionnaire  were  used to collect data.  Findings showed   that District Election Trainers applied adult learning principles  ; by allowing poll staff  to talk   about their experiences with elections, by using  proper language when addr essing poll staff , by   making  poll staff  participate  in the training. The findings  further  show ed how  role plays  were   utilised in the training  to depict real life situati ons. However, D istrict Election Trainers  were   unable to effectiv ely apply the principle s due to:  the large number of poll staff they had to train,    limited time allocated to the  training, and Some District Election Trainers did not know much   about  adult learning principles  later on  how to apply  them when training poll staff . The   respondents  therefore,  suggested that by recruiting more  District Election Trainers , extending   the training period  and introducing workshops where they could be taught on the principles   would help them apply the  adult learning  principles better  when training poll staf f and enhance   the training . Thus , the  study recommended that the Elect oral Commission of Zambia should    introduce workshops  or seminars,  where D istrict Election Trainers can  be taught on adult   learning principles comprehensively. The study also recommended that the government should    consider allocating more money in election training so that the commission could recruit more   District Election Trainer s to make training the numbers of poll staff manageable.    Key words:  District election t rainer, application, ad ult learning principles and poll staff.                 \n",

God is at home, it's we who have gone out for a walk.    The price of inaction is far greater than the cost of making a mistake.    Over and above, I thank God for the sufficient grace and strength throughout this PhD   Journey. Indeed as in HIS WORD: \"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made   perfect in weakness.\" 2 Corinthians 12:9 & “For I know the plan s I have for you,” declares   the Lord, “plans to prosper  you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”     Jeremiah 29:11.    I pray the “thank you”  prayer every day of my life for the abundant blessings that I have   received. Yet, it somehow does  not seem to be enough to only say \"thank you\" to those I am   about to recognise.    I am greatly indebted to my sole supervisor Dr Daniel Ndhlovu for providing me with   guidance, encouragement, wisdom and constructive criticism throughout this academic   journey .  My supervisor was indeed my mentor as he made me realise that though the   undertaking seemed impossible it was feasible.  I stumbled many times along the pathway,   and yet he made me realise that I needed to pick up the pieces and journey on. As I travell ed   with this scholar, my mentor, I began to realise that actually it was more about the learning   process than the destination. I thank you for allowing me to stagger, for providing important   tips at the right time and for not giving up on me. You made me h ave confidence in that the \n",

            "    v                                                        ABSTRACT       The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of strategic management practices on   the performance of selected small and medium scale enterprises in the construction sector in   Lusaka District, from 2006 to 2016. The study adopted a descriptive rese arch design. The   target population for the study were SMEs in the construction sector in Kalingalinga, Buseko,   Mtendere, Mtendere East, and Kabwata. These areas were chosen because they accommodate   a lot of SMEs that are in the construction industry. Strat ified and purpose sampling were   adopted so as to give each item in the population an equal probability of being selected. The   sample size for the study were 50 managers of SMEs, who were chosen purposively. The   researcher used a questionnaire as a primary data collection instrument. The questionnaire   collected qualitative and quantitative data. The questionnaire was administered through drop   and pick method to the managers working in the selected SMEs. The questionnaire responses   were checked, grouped into various categories to facilitate for analysis using descriptive   statistics. Frequency distribution tables were used to summarise the data from respondents.   The analysed data was presented in frequency distributions tables, pie charts and bar charts   for eas e of understanding and analysis.       The study established that SMEs in the construction sector in Lusaka District adopted   moderate strategic management practices in relation to the strategic management model. The   study also established that SMEs faced numer ous challenges in the running of their   businesses. The study further established that the adopted strategic management practices   influenced performance of SMEs in the construction sector in Lusaka District. The study   concludes that strategic management pra ctices have an influence on performance of SMEs in   the construction sector. The study recommends that owners of SMEs in the construction   sector in Lusaka District and other organisations need to adopt best strategic management   practices if performance of t heir enterprises were to improve. While adopting the strategic   management practices, they should always make sure that the process is as inclusive as   possible. It is also recommended that in order to reduce on high rate of business failures,   SME owners nee d to develop interest in improving their managerial skills through regular   training. Further, owner managers need to formulate superior strategic objectives that include   adoption of technology and innovation, business efficiency and good customer service. \n",

            "      v    ABSTRACT    Water insecurity is increasingly becoming a global problem, and African cities are  at the coalface of   this challenge. The water insecurity challenges in African cities are due in part to an interweave of   factors such as rapid and often unplanned urbanisation, poor quality of infrastructure and high levels   of urban informality. These limitations make informal settlements in African cities most susceptible   to high r isks of water insecurity. In Zambia, seventy -two percent of households have access to clean   drinking water  while seventy -two percent of Lusaka population lives in informal settlements with   very poor access to reliable water services . Lusaka has previously recorded fluctuation and reductions   in rainfall patterns and this has had a  direct bearing on w ater insecurity  in the city and its region .   Despite efforts by governments and various stakeholders to deal with rampant water insecurity   problems in African cit ies, including Lusaka, urban water challenges persist. The  issue  of water   insecurity remains unclearly characterized, and interventions are primarily reactive rather than   proactive, making failure of interventions eminent. By focusing on George sett lement in Lusaka, this    study aims to examine determinants of water insecurity and urban resilience in the water sector in   informal settlements of Lusaka. Data for this study were collected using semi -structured interviews,   observations, grey literature and media sources. Thirty -five community residents and nine key   informants from various institutions in the water sector in Lusaka were selected purposively to   participate in the study. The data were analysed qualitatively to enable the study drill -down to lived   realities through  narratives and themes. The findings show that the key drivers of water insecurity in   George settlement are centred on water scarcity and long distances to safe water sources (communal   water sources), underground water contamination as eviden ced by ‘deep community stories of dirty’    water. In addition to rampant vandalism of scanty water infrastructure and rinsing demand for water   in the community, George settlement faces a spiral of interweaved challenges such as physical   insecurity, high pove rty levels and near complete failure of urban planning. These complex issues   interact intensely to shape livelihoods and water use behaviours in a clearly visible water insecure   settlement . To survive in such a waterscape, residents deploy a diverse set of  strategies that include   ensuring multiple water sources for different uses, deployment of extreme water rationing measures   and use of innovative and climate -sensitive options such as rainwater harvesting. The study further   establishes while George has bee n upgraded many times, settlement upgrading approaches in the   area have  not addressed water challenges in the area and that city planning has not deployed an   integrated approach. Settlement upgrading efforts and city planning measures have not contributed   to resilience building in the  water sector in George settlement . Based on the findings, the study   recommends effective implementation of the  Lusaka Slum Upgrading and Prevention Strategy ,   increased investments in  water infrastructure  and establish ment of  devolved water management   systems and processes.                                   \n",

            "6    1.3 Study Justification    When dealing with a tumour of the Parotid  gland, clinicians/surgeons were presented with a   complex anatomy and pathology that made therapeutic management challenging1, 2, 3, 4, 9. The fact   that the Parotid  gland is divided by the facial nerve into a superficial and a deep lobe entails that   this n erve is at high risk of injury during core needle biopsy and incisional biopsy and these two   procedures also complicate into seeding of malignant cells (in the case of malignant tumours) and   formation of salivary fistulae, but there is no evidence that FNA C causes these complications6.      Clinical diagnosis result s in over treatment of participants with inflammatory lesions (who d o not   need surgery and could be managed medically or conservatively) and benign lesions that had been   treated as malignant tumours with total Parotid ectomy with excision of the facial nerve resulting   in facial nerve paralysis4.      Clinical diagnosis has grave  consequences4:   a) It does not rely on a tissue diagnosis.    b) It has resulted in increased postoperative morbidity due to Parotid  surgery done for   inflammatory lesion or facial nerve excision done in a benign Parotid  gland tumour.        Studies have shown that FNAC has established a role in the diagnosis of Parotid  gland tumours as   indicated by Attilio et al12, Choudhury et al4 and Khandekar et al10.   FNAC can distinguish Parotid    gland cells from non -Parotid  gland cells, it can distinguish inflammatory from neoplast ic lesions   and benign from malignant cells. However these studies had also noted that due to overlapping   morphological features of Parotid  gland tumours, FNAC had at times failed to provide a diagnosis   and it had also failed to accurately diagnose malignan t tumours4, 9. This had been a source of   controversy for most clinicians and surgeons as to whether FNAC could be relied upon instead of   examination of frozen sections during surgery4, 9, 16, 17. But again frozen sections are not commonly   found in most cen tres and are not done in Zambia. Hence most patients had been operated without   preoperative diagnosis, without proper counselling and they had increased morbidity associated   with over treatment such as facial nerve palsy (3 of the 14 patients who had super ficial   Parotid ectomy in 2011), and under treatment in cases where lesions that were thought to be benign \n",

            "v    Abstract    In Zambian agriculture, women generally perform most activities such as weeding, harvesting,   stocking, marketing and processing than men who are largely involved in tillage. However, women   are marginalized in terms of access to and ownership of productive assets. In response, government,   civil society, private institutions and international donors are increasingly targeting women   smallholder  farmers in poverty reduction and food security programme s in rural areas. Despite   increased focus of donors towards i mproving livelihoods of women smallholder farmers, evidence   shows that benefits accruing to women farmers in development projects are often quite elusive. The   purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the Norwegian Women Empowerment Programme    on li velihoods of women smallholders in Senanga. The study identified benefits accruing to    programme  participants, how the programme  targeted the beneficiaries and how project benefits   affect economic status of beneficiaries. Th e study adopted a qualitative app roach based on   purposive sampling of 1 farmer group under the project which was the most accessible. Data was   collected using a semi -structured interview schedule, focus group discussion guide and key   informant interviews. Descriptive statistics and themat ic analysis were  used to analyse primary    data. Programme  benefits included ; trainings, agricultural inputs, credit and market access. Most   participating smallholder farmers benefited more from provision of farming inputs such as seed (74    percent ), fertilizer (72  percent ) and training (32  percent ). None reported benefits due to  credit and   market  support . On targeting of pro gramme  beneficiaries’  71 percent  said they joined the   programme  from self -interest after sensitization from Programme Against Malnutrition ( PAM ).   This targeting mechanism was criticized by key informants from The Ministry of Community   Development and Social Services  as having resulted in elite capture of project benefits. The study   also found that women smallholder farmers did not experience posit ive changes in all domains of   women empowerment as their freedom of mobility in public space was found to be lim ited to   attending religious functions and programme  meetings alone. The study recommends that project   participatory monitoring and beneficiary assessments should be carried out periodically to get direct   feedback from beneficiaries about issues around elite capture and preference targeting of   beneficiaries . To really attain women empowerment goals, donor projects should address the   agency domain by providing economic benefits high such as market and credit support . Finally,   that agricultural development Programme s with a goal to empower women smallholder fa rmers,   should focus on activities that result in changes in their agency (capabilities), structure   (institutions/ organizations  that surround them) and relations (power relations).  \n",

            "vi    Abstract       This study analysed the effectiveness of the roles of civil society organisation s in peace building   in Zambia. The objectives of this study were to, evaluate the efficacy of the roles of civil society   organizations in peace building , investigate the extent to which civil society organisation s   engage youths and political players in peac e building activities , assess people‟s perception s on   the roles of civil society organisations and to determine the chall enges that civil society   organis ations face in peace building in the Republic of Zambia. Both questionnaires and   interview guides  were used to collect information from the respondents. Questionnaires were   used to collect information from students  in three selected higher learning institution s and bus   drivers as well as  marketers. Q ualitative and quantitative methods were used to analyse the   findings . Quantitative method was used to present the findings collected using questionnaires   while qualitative method was used to analyse the find ings collected using interviews and focus   group discussions.     This study revealed that the three church mother bodies  play various roles in peace building  in   Zambia. These roles include  acting as inter -mediation and facilitation, advocates for citizens‟   human rights and promote inter -group social cohesion in peace building process. This study al so   revea led that the majority people in Zambia were  not involved in peac e building. The study also   revealed  that the majority  political leaders were not showing interest of working together with   the three church mother bodies in peace building in the country. It was also revealed in this study    that civil society organisations face different challenges in promoting peace in the country which   included,  being p erceived as political partisan a ssociation s, lack of willingness by pol itical   leaders to work with Civil Soci ety O rganisations  (CSO)  in peace building programmes and   financial challenges  in Zambia.        \n",

This   involved thr ee Mission Secondary Schools and the communit ies.      A qualitative research approach and a case study design was employed to conduct this study . The   research methods utilized in the study were: Semi -structured Interview s/discussions  and Focus -  group discussio ns. These  were used to obtain in -depth informa tion from the selected Mission   Secondary S chools in Mongu District which involved ; head teachers, teachers, learners and   parents. The resultant qualitative d ata were analysed thematically  and descriptively , using a social   constructivist lens.       The study findings indicated  that the ‘Right to Education ’ for the girl child was granted  in selected   Mission Second ary Schools of Mongu District. The s tudy findings also revealed  that, the ‘Right   to Education ’ for the girl child was also violated by the selected Mission Secondary Schools in   Mongu District .  The s tudy findings further revealed that, t here were a number of negative effects   as a result of the violation  of the ‘Right to Education ’ for girl child  in the select ed Mission   Secondary Schools and th e Community.       The study recommended that the Ministry of General Education through the local authority  must   ensure that the ‘Right to Education ’ is grant ed in all schools in the country and also  to investigate   this violat ion of the ‘Right to Education ’ for the girl child . Furthermore, the Ministry of General   Education should incorporate the community as well as the C hurch in Mongu District in finding   possible ways of implement ing the Re -Entry Policy in schools in general a nd Mission Secondary   Schools in particular.

The study revealed  that if all these solutions were worked on  the resulting factor  would be ,   improved proficiency  of the children in Chinyanja and  consequently, very  easy for them to gain   reading skills in Chinyanja and the same  skills would be transferred to  English.    Finally, t he study made further  recommendations:  parents needed to be sensitized in the PLP;   Chinyanja should be used as LoI from pre -school to grade 3 and then English should  take over   from grade 4 onwards. It further recommended  that the M inistry of Education should give money   to schools to buy instructional materials on their own instead of giving them the materials in what   they called Free Education Materials (FEMs).                                                  \n",

            "iv    ABSTRACT    The purpose of this study was to explore the lived experiences of teachers on long distance   marriage in Choma District of Zambia. Th e study was guided by the following research   questions; what are the challenges faced by teachers on distant marriage? What are the factors   that lead to distant marriage on teachers? What is the impact of long distant marriage on teachers   and finally, to w hat are the altitudes of teachers on long distance marriage in the three secondary   schools of Choma District? These questions formed the main basis for the achievement of the   study’s overarching purpose highlighted earlier. The three main factors that cont ributed to   teacher’s leaving apart were employment, promotions and transfers. The highlighted factors can   stabilize  a family .Family life is important in every society because it comes with positive   benefits, which include good parenting, social fulfilmen t, economic balance, conjugal   responsibility, among others. Despite the importance of family life and the benefits that come   with it, government does not consider marriage values to be aligned to work. Certainly, the   positive effects of marriage may not be  ascertained by people who live apart on commuter   marriage.       Lived experiences of teachers on long distant marriage are of concern. The aim of this study was   to assess the lived experiences of teachers faced with long distant marriages and the dynamics on   perceived marital as well as job fulfilment in Zambia. In order to assess the lived experiences of   teachers on long distance marriage, three objectives guided this study that is; to assess the causes   that lead to  distant marriage on teachers, to explor e the performance of teachers on long distant   marriages and thereafter to establish teacher’s altitudes towards  long distant marriage.  Six main   components of teacher profession were: teachers’ family life, parenting, availability on duty,   performance, fi nances and communication.    This ethnographic and phenomenological research was conducted at three secondary schools of   Choma district. Ethnographic study is defined as a method of qualitative methodology that lends   itself to the study of the social interac tions, and behaviours’ of small societies, involving   participation and observation over a period of time, and the interpretation of the data.    Finally, the following recommendations were made; need for convenient change of station   process or by putting marr ied workers in reachable distances .Redesign the conditions of service   from individualized to a more family accommodative one, reduce on years to serve from one   station from 4 to 2 years respectively. Furthermore, improve the teacher’s conditions of servic e   to allow them to run two homes amidst economic pressure .In as much as government desires to   reduce on teacher pupil ratio in peri - urban and rural schools teacher motivation, is supposed to   be the base of employment, retention and promotion .A happy and  marital fulfilled teacher may   increase high productivity as compared to a frustrated one.    Key terms : Long distance marriage, deployment, promotion, transfers.   \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT    This descriptive research design study documen ted and establis hed the influence of the   School Health and Nutrition (SHN)  program  on the nutritional practices of the schools and   the surrounding communities. Both probability and non-probability sampling techniques   were used  to collect data which  was analyzed using both quantitative and qualitative   techniques. The study has revealed that school -community learning from the SHN program   has only minimally taken place but  has led to some notable improvement in nutritional   practice s in communities. The study has shown that school -going children are slightly more   knowledgeable on SHN matters than the  parents and that better hygiene and nutritional   practices were more practised at school than at home. The study has revealed that School   SHN coordinators manage the day to day running of the program but have no real decision -   making power which is the preserv e of the head teachers . It was also revealed that there is   very little collaboration between school management and the communities in the   implementation and management of SHN. The study has further revealed  that most schools   do not have any meaningful ways  of sustaining SHN . The study recommend s, therefore , that    the M inistry of General Education should revise the SHN policy to enhance  nutritional    learning in practic al terms . Schools should involve nutritionists in conducting needs   assessment in schools and come up with programs that can be carried side by side with   program like SHN so as to improve health and nutrition and well -being of pupils in and   outside schools . The MoE and MoH should make it mandatory  or encourage  for parents to   get involved in nutriti on learning and practice by making sure that they are not left out on   decision making and planning . The MoGE  should enlarge and  twin SHN implement ation to   Production Unit  programs including  gardening, citrus fruit production, growing of maize in   the school  farm, teaching learners on improved food production methods and agricultural   entrepreneurship skills, demonstration of sustainable agricultural methods like crop rotation   and conservation agr iculture should be sustainable.    Key Words : School Health and Nutrition , Learning, Management , Sustainability.        \n",

            "v    Abstract    Multi -banking among bank account holders is a trend that has been on the rise in the rece nt past.    Even though most banks provide similar services, like money transfer, deposits, loans, safety   vault keeping, insurance and other services, it is seen that consumers have preference to certain   specific banks. Banks still face issues with customers switching from one bank to another in   search of either better service, low cost, convenience of access, international transaction services   and many other unexplored factors. This study assesses the lived experiences of multi -banked   bank account holders at Manda Hill Mall  Lusaka, Zambia .       Data was generated from seven  purposively sampled multi -banked account holders using; in -  depth interviews , focus group  discussions , informal discussions and observations. Findings were   analyzed using thematic analysis. Fac tors that emerged contributing to multi -banking among   account holders were fraternity, proximity, customer service, security and brand loyalty. The   study through interviews revealed that proximity to banks caused the customers to be multi -  banked. The study  further showed that some banks have poor services which do not even   motivate the customers to continue serving with them hence multi -banking.  It was found that   online banking reduces the queues being experienced in some banks for the customers‟ problems   are solved through the click of a button. The study also found that  when customers  trust a bank   brand , it makes them loyal to the bank and when they are loyal they also encourage their   colleagues to join the banks to which they belong to. From the participa nts‟ perceptions, options   for reducing multi -banking were enhanced customer services, improved bank security, reduced   fraternity behaviour and enhanced proximity. Research findings showed that banks should ensure   that there is no unnecessary sudden closure s of branches across their network as this builds the   confidence levels in clients so much that customers feel their money is secure unlike when there   are continuous changes and short notice closures of bank branches and ATMs services.       Thus this study con cludes that most of the factors that influence multi -banking involve the   attitude of the account holders, dependency on fraternity, security constraints and poor customer   services. This study recommends that banks need to improve their service provision an d   strengthen relationships with their customers, and enhancement of security to the satisfaction of   customers. On the other hand account holders should be accorded chance to be well informed   and independent in making decisions based on scientific evidence as to which bank to bank with.                          \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT    The main goal of this study was to analyse the challenges o f Stanbic  Bank  Zambia’s digital   innovation services on customer satisfaction among the bank’s customers. The study sampled   50 customers and collected data using questionnaires. A descriptive survey design was used in   the study. Quantitative data collected was coded and fed into a computer statistical software   SPSS to run the analyses. Descriptive data analysis entailed counts, percentages, cross -  tabulations, and measures of central tendencies. Correlation analysis was used to check the   relationship between dependent and independent variables. Qualitative data from the research   schedule entailed the use of thematic analysis techniques. The results were interpreted and data   were presented in tables for uniformity and ease of interpretation. The study found tha t the   customers at Stanbic Bank, Zambia were indifferent about the system timeouts on digital   banking platforms provided by the bank causes disruptions in service provision. The majority   of the males influenced this response as the majority of females disa greed with the assertion   that system timeouts cause any service disruptions. The researcher also found that network   problem when reaching the digital banking platforms was a major challenge in digital banking   systems especially among male customers, and th is led to customer frustration and   dissatisfaction. Among females, the length of time it took for reversals to be processed caused   frustration and customer dissatisfaction. These challenges led many customers to feel; online   banking platforms are unreliabl e. The study concluded that Banks need to use data and   behavioural analytics to improve and iterate the customer acquisition process continuously. By   identifying the friction points, where activities stall and errors occur, banks can make   incremental chang es to improve over time.  The study recommends that to have faster processes   in digital banking, there is a need by banks to invest more in robust reliable systems to reduce   incidents of failed transactions and transactional errors in ATMs, Mobile banking, and POS   terminals. Banks should further automate most services like loan recovery, loan disbursement   and introduce queue management systems.      \n",

            "iv       ABSTRACT    The study investigated the  processing and issuance of certificate of title deeds at the Ministry of   Lands and Natural resources in Lusaka District. The study was guided by four research objectives:   a). to document how title deeds are processed and the standard time of processing and  issuing of   title deeds at the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources b). To determine why tittle deeds take   long to process Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources c).  To ascertain how the processing and   issuance of title deeds can be met within the sta ndard time. The study used a mixed methods design   to collect data from a sample of 120 participants. Data was collected from employees from the   Ministry of Lands, landowners and Meanwood Property Developers officers using a questionnaire   and an interview g uide. The study findings revealed that the standard time for processing and   issuing of title deeds was dependent on how soon the client presented the full documentation to   the Ministry of Lands and how consistent the client made follow ups to ensure the pa perwork was   worked on. The stipulated three months’ time was not always applicable to the common citizens.   Further findings established that title deeds which were processed by individual clients took long   to come out because the paperwork was not well com pleted, and they did not have sufficient time   to make follow ups. The clients who did not make follow ups with incomplete paperwork had their   files misplaced in the long ran and blamed the Ministry for not issuing the title. The processing of   the title dee ds at the Ministry of Lands was manually done and there was no electronic   notifications, but physical check up on the progress until the process was completed. Property   developers processed titles faster than individuals because they were familiar with the  process.   The study recommended that the Ministry of Lands should employ an online system of contacting   the clients after lodgment of documents so that they are notified on the next stage of their paper   processing of the title deeds. This can be done by li nking the file number for the client to their   email and phone numbers so that an automatic message is sent to the client on what needs to be   done next.    Key words: title deeds, certificates, Ministry of Lands            \n",

            "   v    ABSTRACT     The main objective of this study was to examine the influence of motivation on teacher work   performance in selected public schools in the Lusaka urban district.  The target population wa s   496 class  Teachers  only, while the sample size of the study was 100 class teachers. The study   employed a descriptive research design, and questionnaires were used to collect data. The study   will be beneficial as it can be used to recognize the significance of motivation that substantially   impacts the profitability and performance of Teachers in public schools. This study will   enhance the teacher's performance by motivational elements to upgrade the instructive   structure. The study will also be b eneficial to policymakers and administrators as it   distinguishes significant methodologies to alter the conduct of teaching personnel on the way   to their job performance. The study found that many motivation(intrinsic) factors that influence   teachers 'work  performance, namely; recognition, responsibility, work itself, advancement,   growth and achievement while under extrinsic motivation, include; company policy and   administration, supervision, status, job security, salary, relationship with supervisors,   relationship with peers, personal life and relationship with subordinates. It was also found that   salary and work conditions under extrinsic motivation caused dissatisfaction with Teacher   work performance. The study concluded that intrinsic motivation and extr insic influence   teacher work performance. The presence of motivational factors can produce job satisfaction   which makes an employee motivated or satisfied, but their absence leads to no job satisfaction.   Therefore, poor hygiene factors can cause job dissat isfaction which makes an employee   demotivated, while better hygiene factors can reduce dissatisfaction but cannot cause job   satisfaction. The study recommends that the Ministry of Education or government provide   incentive packages to increase teachers' mot ivation. Particular attention should be put on   increasing teachers' salaries and increments because most teachers complained of inadequate   salaries to meet their needs. Increasing teachers' salaries will increase their morale to teach and   encourage equity between effort put into the job and promotion to encourage hard work and   good work performance.  \n",

            "    v Abstract    This dissertation  reports a study that was c arried out to investigate how reading   comprehension was taught in selected secondary schools of Lusaka district in Zambia. Data   was collected from three secondary schools -all single sex schools. From the three, one was a   boy’s school and the other two girl s. The researcher used qualitative methodology in data   collection as well as data analysis. Lesson observation, semi -structured interviews and focus    group discussions were the methods used to elicit information from the respondents. The   findings of the stu dy revealed that reading comprehension was not taught in the manner it is   supposed to. Most comprehension lessons we re characterized by testing instead of teaching.   The morale of most teachers’  vis-à-vis their topic was low and that was portrayed by the   manner in which they started and ended their lessons. Some noticeable features of   comprehension lessons observed were poor lesson presentations, unsatisfact ory general   lesson delivery, poor  teaching techniques, teacher’s non -reading culture and pupils’ lack of   confidence in some teachers. Others were insufficient reading materials in some schools and   the prevalence of outdated books. In a bid to address the challenges of teaching reading   comprehension in secondary schools, it was recommended that Ministry of Education should   introduce short refresher courses for teachers of English aimed at ensuring effectiveness in   teaching methodology and hence improving the quality of their lessons. That should be done   after every two years. To make that achievable, governm ent should allocate more funds to   Teacher Education in order carry out  such projects. It should also devise a policy that   promote s reading at pre -school, lower and middle basic school so as to make pupils already   familiar to reading as they get into second ary school. Government should further motivate   teachers by improving their conditions of service.                 \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT       No child should have to worry about his or her safety and welfare. Unfortunately, research   shows that  millions of children around the world are at risk for violence, abuse, and   exploitation. There are several threats to the safety of children, most of which are   interconnected  (UNICEF, 2021). Therefore,  this study  focused on  the practices of secondary   schools in ensuring the protection of their children in Lusaka district of Lusaka province of   Zambia. The aim of this study was to explore the involvement of secondary schools in   protecting children from vi olence, exploitation and sexual abuse.    The study was guid ed by the following objectives: i). Describe the prevalence of cases of   violence, exploitation and sexual abuse among children in secondary schools in Lusaka   district.  ii). Explore the measures take n to protect children from violence, exploitation and   sexual abuse in selected secondary schools.  iii). Explore gaps in the actions taken to deal with   child protection concerns in selected secondary schools in Lusaka district.    This study employed a qualita tive methodology guided by a case study design  in the light of   learned helplessness theory . Additionally, the study adopted  systematic  and purposive   sampling techniques  to enrol four secondary schools and to enlist thirty -six (36) participants   respectively. The participants were distributed as follows: thirty -two pupils; one Headteacher;   two Deputy Headteachers and one Head of Department. The data of this research were   collected using focus group discussions with pupils and intervi ew schedules on school   administrators. The qualitative data were analysed thematically by comparing and   categorising participants‟ responses .    The findings of the study  revealed that violence, exploitation and sexual abuse are very much   prevalent in secondary schools . However, it is difficult to ascertain the prevalence because of   underreporting of these cases by the pupils. Cases of sexual abuse were found to be more   prevalent among the girls and cases of physical abuse were more pronounced among the    boys. The study also revealed that teachers are usually the perpetrators of these cases.    The study made six recommendations, three of which are outlined below: i). the  government   through the Ministry of General Education should strengthen the child protec tion policies in   schools, ii).  the government through the Ministry of Higher Education should introduce a   course in guidance and counselling , iii). School  administrators should get more involved in   the activities of the guid ance and counselling department.  \n",

            "v    From the observations and interviews carried out, it was established that a lot of factors affecting   literacy skills development made learners not to be exposed to interactive language as most of   the people around them were not native sign ers. Very few interactions were noted among   learners with hearing impairment, teachers and their parents as well as their hearing counterparts.   It was also noted that the home language of HI learners was Cinyanja, which is different from the   Sign Language and signed English used by their children with hearing impairment.    The study revealed that the School has teachers who have not undergone any training in special   education and sign language in particular and these teachers have just keen interest to teach    hearing impairment despite this and this interest is also encouraged by some teachers who are   incompetence in teaching sign language.     The research observed that the Catch -up was not adopted by the School as a methodology to   develop  literacy skills among HI learners. The researchers further observed that the teachers at   Magwero Deaf do not know that the 2013  revised curriculum introduced sign language as a   subject and that there is sign language Syllabus in place from grade 1 to 7 to promote the literacy   learning among the HI learners at primary school level. The general aim of was to enable   learners with hearing impairment gain/acquire literacy competences that would enable them   function comfortably in society.    The study recommended strengthening of train ing pre-school special education teachers, training   of sign language teachers and teachers to be sensitized to use sign language syllabus when   teaching of sign language as an academic subject. T hey should use Zambian sign language and   signed English as sole medium of classroom instruction.  It was recommended that a variety of   strategies to provide meaningful language experiences be employed.                           \n",

            "v | P a g e     issues that came out were having overcrowded clas srooms, overworked teachers and in adequate   text books. What also came out were  the poverty levels which in some cases led to not having   three meals in a day. Motivation for teachers was also cardinal in producing good results.   Equating this situation to K alumbila district this is true. The North Western Province strategic   plan also talks about the need for strengthening the efficiency and effectiveness of the education   management system in the province.       Having carried out the study the following were my  findings it was discovered that most   schools were operating without setting goals as to where they were and what they intended to be   in future. Administrator interviewed also talked about having fewer teacher hence not being very   effective in managing the ir schools,  working with teams , multi tasking and managing groups   while  overseeing their school operations proved very difficult to most of the administrators   talked to. On the second objective little was being done to interpret the results which the sch ool   had. Only 5 schools indicated that they were having teacher group meetings. This was not a   healthy sign.    The following are my recommendations: firstly all administrators should be trained in   educational management. Secondly administrators should not b e left to act for a very long time it   de motivates them. The reading records kept by the school should always be used to make future   decisions.                                   \n",

            "[v]       ABSTRACT    The purpose of the study was to explore the role of traditional marriage counsellors in resolving   marria ge conflicts in Senama village. The objectives included; to determine the nature of counselling   offered to married couples by traditional counsellors. Secondly, to assess factors that influence   accessibility of traditional counselling services among couples thirdly, to ascertain challenges faced by   traditional counsellors in conflict resolution and l astly, to establish measures to enhance traditional   counselling in conflict resolution.    An explorative design was used. A qualitative technique was used in the collection of data. The   qualitative techniques involved use of interview, semi structured interv iews, questionnaires and focused   group discussion. The sample comprised 51 participants. The findings revealed that majority of the   participants were aware of the existence of traditional counselling services and felt that such services   had the potential o f providing viable knowledge and information on marriages and in fact reducing   divorce and GBV although others still felt traditional marriage counsellors were not helpful.     The study also found out the factors that influence the accessibility of marriage  counselling included;   culture, unfaithfulness or infidelity were some of them. The participants also faced a number of   challenges when it came to traditional marriage counselling, such as; lifestyle or culture of the   contemporary generation, skills or qua lification of tradition marriage counsellors and the inefficiency   of legal institutions such as the courts of law and the Victim Support Unit. However, the participants   also mentioned some of the measures that could address the challenges, these include; i nculcating   traditional values in the future generation, revising the curriculum for traditional marriage counselling   and couples to minimise seeking help from traditional marriage counsellors.    The following recommendations that traditional counselling had  the potential of sustaining marriages   and could help to reduce rate of divorce and GBV if the society gave marriage counselling the outmost   respect that it holds in the society that is preserving  the culture among others . Furthermore, the   environments for  counselling should be improved to enhance privacy which most couples look for.   Lastly, that, marriage counsellors should have a common syllabus and not a tribal based one because   there a number of intermarriages in the recent years.

On Bruce ladder Multiplex PCR, the Brucella  strain had similar phenotypic   chara cteristi cs as the Brucella  vaccine strain S19.  All isolates (3,  8 and 12) were resistant to   trimethoprim -sulfameth oxazole, doxycycline, tetracycline and chloramphenicol but sensitive to   rifampicin.  All three isolates showed intermediate resistance to cip rofloxac in.   The overall brucellosis seroprevalence rates at the individual animal and herd levels were 9.92   per cent  and 32 per cent  respectively.   Brucella species are circulating  in human and bovine milk   in the Southern province of Zambia.   Molecular typ ing of the iso lated Brucella  spp.  DNA   indicates that they belong to the Brucella abortus  S19 vaccine strain.   While vaccination is the   traditional and recommended method for controlling brucellosis, the current study findings show   that the S19 vaccine tha t we are  using  continues to be detected not only in animals and animal   products but also in humans long after it has been used in animals underscores it is  zoonotic   transmission potential from cattle to humans  which seems to be a public health problem.                       \n",

            "v    Abstract     Traditional societies are those that are governed by customs and traditions of a particu lar   group of people. The leadership structure s of such societies consist of a chief or a king, and   village headman and ot her local leaders. These are the people who take care  of the  day to   day happenings in the chiefdom or village and they help to make sur e that people live in   harmony. Despite the presence of all these leaders, conflicts still occur among the people   and this threatens the peace. The focus of this study was to investigate the occurrence of   conflicts in senior chief Ndubeni’s chiefdom and est ablish what method of dispute   resolution is preferred by the local people of this chiefdom  between the modern or western   dispute resolution mechanism and the indigenous or traditional dispute resolution   mechanism.    The study was undertaken in order to unde rstand how conflicts are resolved between   people  in a traditional society, particularly senior chief Ndubeni’s chiefdom in Mpongwe   district . The research process involved the collection of data through scheduled semi -  structured interview guides which were administer ed in person by the researcher in order   to obtain primary data. The major findings of the study were that the local people of senior   chief Ndubeni’s chiefdom prefer to use the indigenous method of dispute resolution  to the   western method . The two  methods of dispute resolution, the traditional and the western,   are available to the people of chief Ndubeni’s chiefdom but there is a perceived preference   for the indigenous method due to i ts easy accessibility and affordability  to the local people .    The study found out that the common causes of conflicts among the people in the   chiefdom include high consumption of alcohol especially by the younger members of the   community. The reason why there is so much beer drinking is because of lack of access to   educ ation and the lack of recreational facilities to keep the young people engaged. It is   therefore imperative that measures be put in place to address these issues which increase   the likelihood of conflict by establishing recreational facilities such as socce r fields,   basketball courts and other sporting facilities. Also, there is need to increase access to   education for the young people so that they can be kept away from the abuse of substances   such as alcohol.  It is also necessary that measures be put in pla ce to increase awareness   among the local people on the importance of both the indigenous methods and the western   methods of resolving conflicts.            \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT    The study strived to assess the administration and management of sports activities which is   problematic to the primary schools of Kapiri Mposhi District in Central Province of Zambia. The   objectives of the study were to: investigate the challenges in the administration and management   of sports activities; establish how much support is rendered to teacher s involved in sports by the   school management in the implementation of sports activities; and evaluate the levels of   performances and competences of teachers in the management of sports activities.    The study used a descriptive survey design which employed the qualitative  strategy in or der to   effectively address the issues raised by the research questions. The descriptive research design   was used to establish the extent to which sports is managed in selected primary schools of Kapiri   Mposhi District. In any case, the method of data colle ction included in -depth structured   questionnaires and focus group discussion s, where some guiding questions were prepared to   collect subjective responses  from the learners involved in sports activities. The target population   included School Management Team s, sports teachers and pupils involved in sports activities in   some selected primary schools of Kapiri Mposhi District.  Both simple random sampling and   purposive sampling techniques were used to select the respondents.    As findings, the study  revealed that sports activities in primary schools continues to be poorly   managed because of lacking infrastructure, funds, sports equipment and having un-skilled and   in-competent teachers managing sports activities. The findings also indicate that  school   managers were not very supportive to the sports teachers in the management of sports activities   and learners lacked balls and sports attires like jerseys. Consequently, the current primary school   curricular does not promote „physical education‟  as an independent subject  to promote and   support sports  activities in primary schools .   As conclusion, the study revealed that the problems and challenges in the administration and   management of sports activities includes inadequate funding, poor and limited infrastructure,   limited  sports materials  and equipment,  and un-skilled teachers  to manage sports activities  who   are not supported by school managers .                                                                        Based on the findings above, the study recommends that there should be adequate and proper   sports infrastructure  in primary schools, adequate financial and material resources support from   the government  through funding schoo ls, and support from school managers . Equally,  physical   education should be revamped in the curricular and teachers should be trained in sports   management to trigger the management of sports activities process in primary schools.      \n",

            "              v    However, the findings also indicate that schools were not just siting idol. Schools were doing   something about this situation. The Parents‟ Teacher Association in collaboration with school   administration had st arted to build classroom blocks and also lobbying from Constituency   Development fund to help in building new classroom blocks.     The study concluded that the implementation of the vocational career pathway was being   implemented in very difficult circumstan ces. The old infrastructure being used was also bad and   inadequate. If the government did not intervene now education provision in the vocational career   pathway will not be up to date and learning will not be taking place. The state will have   graduates wit hout the skills, knowledge and a changed behaviour to fit in any society beyond   Zambia. Based on these findings the study recommends that the government should first allocate   some initial funding for infrastructure, equipment, teaching and learning resourc es and   specialists before upgrading a primary school into a secondary school.                                              \n",

Most infrastructures in schools does not support the requirements of   the new curriculum, and this affects the smooth implementation of the project. Finally, studies   revealed th at most of the schools have teaching and learning materials, though they are not updated   in line with the revised 2013 curriculum as some of the su bject matter is  new in the revised   curriculum and this affects the content which teachers give to the pupils.  The study revealed that,   the revision of any curriculum should firs start with looking at factors that could affect the   implementation and having them in place, as findings showed that human resource, infrastructure   and teaching materials have an effect o n the implementation process of the revised 2013   curriculum. The researcher made four clear recommendations which were based on the findings   of the study.                                      \n",

            "v    Abstract    The purpose of the  study was to investigate  the violation of the ‘Right to Education ’ for the girl   child in some selected Mission Secondary S chool s in Mongu District of Western Province. This   involved thr ee Mission Secondary Schools and the communit ies.      A qualitative research approach and a case study design was employed to conduct this study . The   research methods utilized in the study were: Semi -structured Interview s/discussions  and Focus -  group discussio ns. These  were used to obtain in -depth informa tion from the selected Mission   Secondary S chools in Mongu District which involved ; head teachers, teachers, learners and   parents. The resultant qualitative d ata were analysed thematically  and descriptively , using a social   constructivist lens.       The study findings indicated  that the ‘Right to Education ’ for the girl child was granted  in selected   Mission Second ary Schools of Mongu District. The s tudy findings also revealed  that, the ‘Right   to Education ’ for the girl child was also violated by the selected Mission Secondary Schools in   Mongu District .  The s tudy findings further revealed that, t here were a number of negative effects   as a result of the violation  of the ‘Right to Education ’ for girl child  in the select ed Mission   Secondary Schools and th e Community.       The study recommended that the Ministry of General Education through the local authority  must   ensure that the ‘Right to Education ’ is grant ed in all schools in the country and also  to investigate   this violat ion of the ‘Right to Education ’ for the girl child . Furthermore, the Ministry of General   Education should incorporate the community as well as the C hurch in Mongu District in finding   possible ways of implement ing the Re -Entry Policy in schools in general a nd Mission Secondary   Schools in particular.

ZPPA has over the years been facing imprudent procurement prac tices in  government   institutions leading to the quality and quantity of procured goods and  services not meeting the   requested  specifications . In some cases actual expenditure is higher than budgeted funds.    Furthermore , this has led to most government projects not being implemented as plan ned and   also negatively affect  the standing of t he government with its stakeholders . It’s against this   background that the research sought to assess  the factors that  negatively affect prudent   procurement practices in public institutions in Zambia ( with specific reference to Ndola and   Kitwe districts) and to identify possible strategies as measures of intervention.    The research was qualitative and it utilized both primary and secondary data. The research   sampled procurement professionals from ten public institutions in Ndola and Kitwe cities of   Zambia. The study identified the main factors that lead to  imprudent procurement practices in    public institutions in  Zambia as unethical practices, political interference, lack of compliance   to regulations and procedures, size and capacity of staff in procurement units, inconsistencies   between local and international regulations, lack of ICT equipment and wrong perception s. The   assessment also  recommends the following strategies and measures in order to enhance prudent   procurement practices:  improve capacity of pro curement staff through training and   development, ensure procurement policies support prudent practices, integration of   procurement function s with ICT and minimize  political interference in public institutions.         \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT    The study explored  school - community linkages in the implementation of a localised curriculum   in six selected schools in Nakonde  District of Muchinga Province . The objectives of the study   were to:  find out the role of the community in the implementation of the localised curriculum,   identify barriers to effective school - community engagement in implementing a local curriculum    and e xplore ways that would enhance school - community collaboration in the implementation of   a localised curriculum. Both qualitative and quantitative research designs were employed. The   research instruments that were used to collect data were questionnaires w hich were administered   to head teachers and teachers and focus group discussion which were used to pupils and parents.   The total sample was 110 comprising 6 head teachers (six), 44 (forty -four) teachers, 36 (thirty -  six) pupils, 24 (twenty -four) PTA executi ve members and school board members). Using    purposive sampling, head teachers, teachers HOD, guidance teachers, grade 7 teachers and   parents were selected while systematic random sampling was used to select pupils.    It was revealed that  both the community and the school acknowledged the importance of   meaningful participation in the implementation of the localized curriculum in order to enhance   school - community linkage . It was also revealed that embracing community participation in the   implementation of th e localized curriculum was considered as a way of promoting and sustaining    the needs of the community such as traditional and cultural heritage (Umutomolo ceremony).    Further, the  study revealed that  most teachers and parents knew very little about reforms on   localization of the curriculum. Head teachers failed to effectively coordinate the program which   the researcher attributed to the head teachers inability to utilize managerial roles like planning,   coordinating and directing. Community members’ participa tion in the implementation of the   localised curriculum was very minimal. The school boards and PTA executives  at some schools   never played their roles and this was one of the barriers  to effective implementation of the   localised curriculum as a link betwee n the school and the community. The study reviewed poor   relationships between teachers and  community members as another ba rrier and lack of   sensitization among others. An evaluation on localised curriculum implementation has not been   done to date so as to identify gaps to fill in for effective application.     \n",

            "v       ABSTRACT    This abstract is based on a study carried out in Misisi ; an informal settlement in the city of   Lusaka. The settlement experiences perennial floods.  However, despite the frequency and   devasting effects of flooding in the area, people co ntinue to live in the settlement. In much of   urban Africa, adaptation to settlement flooding has been community -driven based on lived   experiences and the use of local resources and rudimental technologies. However, there has been   a contested debate regardi ng the value of local knowledge and experience in disaster risk   reduction for a wholesome flood adaptation response in African cities. Often viewed as   ‘backwards’, governments instead based on foreign  ideas have emphasized ‘advanced’ alien   technologically sophisticated and economically expensive approach es which are often non -  consultative and alien to local liv ing conditions. This study sought  to examine the rationalities   that influence the implementation of community -based adaptation strategies to mitigate  flooding   in Misisi. The aim was achieved by the following objectives: To investigate the role of   community governance systems for flood adaptation, to spatially map flood risk areas using   community and experiential knowledge, to identify community -driven adaptati on strategies and   to examine instances of differences between community and state approaches to urban flood risk   mitigation in Misisi. The study used a case study research approach . It was designed as a   descriptive and interpretive inquiry analysed  through a mixed  methods  approach . The study was   based on data purposively collected from 65 households and supplemented by 3 key informants   from state institutions with a stake in flood management and mitigation in the settlement. Key   methods employed in collecting  empirical evidence included semi -structured interviews with   flood -affected households , in-depth  interviews with  ward leaders, and state officials and   mapping of zones by the severity of flooding. Non -participant observation, primarily taking   photographs, complemented these methods. Data was analysed through descriptive statistics,   content and narrative analysis.  Spatial data were analysed using spatial modelling in GIS.    Findings show that the area Councillor, Ward Development Committee (WDC) and Zone   Representatives make up the main governance structure  in Misisi  which are responsible for   organising  the community to build community -based flood resilience systems. The study   identified t wo flooding zones namely low  and highly flooded based on geospa tial modelling and   the frequency of occurrence of urban flooding in the area . From a total of 4,965 houses  in Misisi,   64% of the houses fall in low flood risks areas, while 3 6% fall in high-risk areas. The community   has employed structural and non -structur e measures to adapt to floods. The most common   adaptation strategies used are the use of sandbags which are place d around their houses; raised   pit latrines and doorsteps; construction of embankments, small drainages, protection walls and   elevation of house  foundations and seasonal temporal displacement.  The research  findings  also   revealed that there is a lack of acceptance by the local government of local people’s knowledge   and their response to floods. This has resulted in conflicting rationalities between  state-led   approaches and the community. The conclusion emphas ises the need for more attention to flood   risk reduction and to working with low -income communities to design flood risk reduction   interventions that align closely with the priorities of local c ommunities .   \n",

Little  is known with regard to   fish consumption patterns and contribution of fish to rural household diets.  Therefore, this study    aimed at assessing the fish consumption patterns and contribution of fish to  rural household diets    in Luwingu district of Northern Province .   A descriptive  cross -sectional  study design  was used. A sample of  132 households with women of   reproductive age (15 -49 years),  children  (6-59 months) , and men  (18-64 years)  in Luwingu   district  were enrolled  in the study . Using a  semi -structured questionnaire , socio -economic and   demographic data  was collected . A food frequency  questionnaire  (with a 7-day recall period)  and   a 24-hour recall  questionnaire were used to collect household and individual dietary data ,   respectively . Data w as analyzed using Statistical Package for Soci al Sciences (SPSS) version   22.0 and Microsoft excel  2013 version , while Nutrisurvey 2007 was used to analyze nutrient    content of foods . Nutrient contribution ratio  was used to determine the contribution of fish t o   diets .    Overall, fi sh was the most consumed animal -source food in the study site.  About 75.8% of the   households consumed fish 24 hours prior to the interview . Other animal -source foods consumed   were eggs (3.8%), meat (1.5%) , and poultry (0.8%) . On average , children  aged 6 -12 months    consumed  60.4 ± 35.2 g of fish per day while those aged 13 -36 months had 73.8 ± 51.0 g and 37 -  59 months consume d 87.9 ± 45.7 g of fish per day . Women and men had a mean intake of  162.1 ±   86.0 g and 173.3 ± 70.0 g of fish per day, respectively.     In 7 days prior to the interview, the study showed that all households (100%)  consumed fish  at   least once in the past 7 days among other animal -source foods . Small pelag ic fish were the most   consumed, as these were consumed once or more times per day.  Other animal source foods   consumed by households included  eggs (31%), meat (13.6%) , and poultry (18%) while the least   consumed animal -source foods were milk (0.8%) and wild birds (3.2%).     The determined intake of micronutrients from fish among  children showed no  significant    difference  in intake  of vitamin A  (p = 0.22) , calcium  (p = 0.544)  and iron  (p = 0.479)  while the   difference in intake  was observed in  proteins  (p = 0.042) .

            "v    ABSTRACT       Market places can be seen as particularly valuable spaces for exchange, negotiation and   mediation, by bringing conflict related groups together, particularly in boundary regions.   Furthermore, business people can be considered as connectors who bring groups together.   Indigenous market associations, landlords (who may provide accommodation, brokerage and   language services to visiting traders), and other intermediaries can use their entrepreneurial   energy for conflict avoidance, in reducing conflict escala tion and in conflict management .   The research therefore investigate the nature of conflicts that exists am ongst the street   vendors and the authorities in the freedom way and the peripheral of Soweto market in   Lusaka city.  The causes of conflict amongst street vendors and the authorities in the freedom   way and peripheral of Soweto market, the effects of confli ct amongst the street vendor traders   and the authorities and also an assessment on  the ways of resolving conflicts on the trading   areas in the freedom way and the peripheral of Soweto market. The research design used was   a qualitative and the sample popul ation was 122 respondents including the street traders,   officials from Lusaka City Council, officials from Zambi a Police Service, Soweto Market    Committee members and Street Vendors Association members       Echoing from the study, the major  challenge  faced by street vendors is eviction by the local   authority.  The other challenge s faced by street traders included: lack of security in the trading   areas, theft and high rental charges by shop owners. These are issues of concern among street   traders.    The s tudy has established that the re is conflict between the local authority and street vendors   trading along freedom way and the peripheral of Soweto market. This could attributed to the   fact that these traders are operating illegally (without licences) echoin g from the Statutory   Instrument Number 44 of 2007, which calls street vending as a public nuisance.       These conflicts have negative impact on the livelihood of the traders as the study revealed   that there was loss of businesses that resulted into loss of in comes among the traders.   Physical damage to both government and private property was also incurred. In some   instances loss of lives had been recorded. Consequently these conflicts affect the economy   through loss of jobs, loss of revenue and tax collection by the local authority.    The study also revealed that the local authority does not engage street vendors in conflict   resolution. Therefore, participation of street vendors in planning and management of conflicts \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT    This study examined t he nexus between political leadership and electoral violence with particular   focus on two major political parties in Lusaka district. The study was anchored on the following   objectives: To explore the leadership styles of the two major political parties; t o establish   whether or not the leadership styles of the two major political parties could influence violence   before, during and after elections; to ascertain whether or not violence was used as a strategy for   winning elections and to analyze  some campaign messages made by politicians so as to ascertain   whether or not they had the potential to influence violence before, during and after elections.    Methodologically, the study used a qualitative descriptive survey design. The following   instruments were used to  gather data: individual interviews, focus group discussion and   document analysis. Using a homogeneous purposive sampling, the study comprised ten (10)   participants from civil society organizations  and one (1) official  from ECZ. It also comprised   four (4) participants from PF and UPND, who were at management level and two (2) councilors   (one from each party). It further comprised fourteen (14) supporters including four youths who   had served in the security wings of the two political parties.    The findings o f the study have shown that all things being equal, there is a nexus between   political leadership and electoral violence. In the first place, the study established that political   leaders in the two major political parties mostly used leadership styles whic h were a mixture of   autocracy, dictatorship, personalized charismatic and laissez faire; all of which had the potential   to influence violence before, during and after elections. Secondly, the study established that in as   much as political leaders claimed t hat they preached peace, they mostly peddled hate messages   before, during and after elections. Lastly, the study established that in as much as they were not   the carriers of violence themselves, political leaders tolerated violence amongst their supporters    and further used it as a strategy for winning elections.    The study recommended inter alia  the need for political leaders to adopt democratic leadership   styles that would foster co -existence, peace, love and reconciliation. Also the need for political   leaders to refrain from issuing statements which had the potential to cause violence, and non-  usage  of violence as a strategy for winning elections or cowing losers into accepting election   results.  \n",

            "V    ABSTRACT    This study investigated teacher representation in decision -making and its role in financial   decisions of selected grant aided secondary schools in Choma District, Zambia.  The objectives   were: to assess the areas in which teachers were involved in decision making; to establish levels   of teachers’ involvement in financial decision making among various categories; to ascertain the   major constraints of teachers’ representation in selected grant aided schools in Choma District.    The study employed  a descriptive d esign and Vroom -Yetton -Jago Contingency Theory of   participative decision making guided the study. Data was collected from a total sample size of 25   participants that comprised 5 head teachers, 15 teachers  and 5 head s of department. The   instruments of data collection used were interview guides containing semi -structured question   items.    The study revealed that teachers  were involved in academic decision making which included   drawing  the agenda for school meetings, selection of school prefects, and discipline of learners   but not directly involved in financial decision making. Heads of department were representatives   of teachers in financial decisions. The study also revealed that heads of  department and head   teachers’ involvement in decision making was higher and minimal for teachers. Further , the   study revealed lack of direct participation of teachers in financial decisions.      The study recommends that administrators in grant aided schoo ls should involve teachers in   financial decisions so as to enhance collective financial decision -making. The Ministry of   General Education should provide training to teachers in the form of workshops, seminars and so   on, in decision making, for them to bec ome competent, and skillful enough to participate in   financial decision -making and hence make the school efficient and effective in achieving its   objectives.  Head teachers should involve all education stakeholders to aid in school development   programmes an d projects. The schools should also initiate income generating projects to   subsidize government funding .      Key words : Decision making, Representation, Teachers.  \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT    Even if a teacher is successfully recruited to a rural school, there are often problems with   retention. T his study looked at management practices of headteachers and teacher retention in   rural primary schools in Kalulushi District of Copperbelt Province. T eacher attrition can be as   high as 30 -50% in certain rural schools (Hobart 2001). The main reason teachers leave rural   areas is isolation: social, cultural, and professional (Collins 1999 ). Teacher  retention in   Kalulushi district possesses a threat to the progressive education sector and the development of   the nation. Managing teacher retention is important for ensuring quality teaching and learning   in rural primary  schools  given society.  A sample of 37  respondents were purposively and   randomly selected and interviewe d. Therefore, this included three  (3) Education Standard   Officers, two  (2) District planning Officers,  2 HROs and  thirty (30) headteachers  from the   selected rural  primary schools.  The study  was mainly qualitative in nature. Thematic analysis   was used to analyse data. This  study was premised under the main aim of investigating   management practices of head teachers and teacher retention in rural primary schools of   Kalulushi district. Teacher attrition is mainly ascribed to poor working conditions. Many of the   rural primary s chools are geographically disadvantaged and bring a lot of challenges to its   inhabitants.  In an effort to address this scenario a qualitative study was  conducted in Kalulushi   with thirty  selected primary schools to be the participating in this research. Pu rposiv ely head   teachers and education officers  were targeted and further a simple random sampling procedure   was implored to select the participa nts. These participa nts have enough experience concerning   teacher retention and its effect on the education of any nation . Data collected was presented   using percentages, frequency distribution tables and other descriptive statistics such as mean,   and standard deviation. This information was displayed by use of bar charts, graphs and pie -   charts. . The  study was mainly qualitative in nature and used a case study design. Thematic   analysis was used to analyse data. The objectives of the study were threefold ; to determine the   staffing levels of teachers in rural primary schools, to  assess the management pr actices of   headteachers  employ on teacher retention in rural primary schools and to explore challenges   headteachers face on teacher retention in rural primary schools.    The findings of the study revealed tha t management practices of headteachers and teacher    retention in  rural  primary schools was due to a number of contributi ng factors that included   lack of managerial skills , inadequate infrastructure, over -enrolment, low teacher morale, few   qualified teachers, rampant teacher and pupil absenteeism , lack of s ocial amenities  and   insufficient funding  and low staffing  levels. This included negative a ttitude for both   headteachers  and teachers, other stakeholders such as parents and learners towards primary   education.  Teacher  retention in Kalulushi district possesses a threat to the progressive   education sector and the development of the nation. Managing teacher retention is important   for ensuring quality teaching and learning in rural primary schools.  The recommendations were    that the local administrators were to address issues of incentives, extra allowances, teaching   and learning materials, work with local parents to build more houses, MOE to address issues of   allowances and salaries, other stakeholders like the council to a ddress issues of road network   and drill enough bore holes in rural schools.  \n",

In summary, through analysing the causes and possible solutions to the succession disputes it was   revealed that indeed there were a number of factors that led to the succession disputes experienced   in the succession of Senior Chief Tafuna. However,  it was also found that not all hope was lost in   finding a lasting solution to the succession disputes of Chief Tafuna. The many possible solutions   suggested and discussed provided a reservoir of idea which if employed were to bring peace in the   selection of Chief  Tafuna and other Lungu chiefs generally.                                                \n",

The findings of this study are likely to be of use to the policy   makers in the Ministry of General Education. It will aid in formulati on of appropriate strategies   to address the implementation of computer studies curriculum in Zambia. Further, basing on   the findings, the researcher recommended that the government should provide grants to schools   to procure more computers, their accessori es and set up infrastructure such as computer   laboratories. The MoGE should also recruit computer studies teachers in all peri -urban schools,   organize regular seminars, workshops and Continuous Professional Development for teachers   and further all Colleges  of Education should incorporate Compu ter studies in their curriculum  \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT    The purpose of this study was to examine motivators of work performance among understaffed   general workers at Roan general hospital and Roan school of nursing. This study was both   quantitative and qualitative in nature . 51 general wo rkers were purposively selected and participated   in the study. Data  was collected through administering self-constructed questionnaires  and   interviews . The key findings from the study revealed that job security and appreciation at work of general   worker by  their superiors were considered the most influential intrinsic motivation  factors while extrinsic   motivators for work performance were wages /salaries. The study also shows that  general wo rkers have   developed coping strategies such as  running small -scale businesses to  sustain themselves .Workers  also   borrow money from leading institution or seek help to sustain their families.   There is a negative    relationship between job satisfaction and  work performance  where the general workers are not   satisfied with the ir work leading to reduced performance.  Most general workers continued working   because they have no other job alternative  as a secure source of income .    The study , therefore , recommends that the  hospital authority  should come up with motivating   factors suc h as awarding general workers who performs better.  It is further recommended that   Roan General Hospital and the School of Nursing should request from Ministry of Health  the   required numbers of general workers  and fill the  positions so that under -staffing w ound be   eliminated . Government  should employ adequate staff for quality work  to be enhanced.                                       \n",

            " v      ABSTRACT    The study sought to investigate teacher transfer: trends and causes (2017 -2018): A case study   of Chibombo district in Central Province. The objectives of the study were to establish the   underlying causes of teacher transfers from Chibombo district between 2017 -2018, to   investigate transfer trend of teachers from and to Chibombo district from 2017 -2018, to   determine the implications of these transfers may have on the overall educational dispensation   in Chibombo district.        The study was conducted in four government secondary schools in Chibombo district and   employed a mixed methods design. Questionnaire was the main instrument of data collection   in addition to interview guide, Observation analysis and document review. The collected data   was analyzed descri ptively using frequency tables. The study revealed the following   revelations; there is a transfer procedure in the Ministry of Education but it is not well known   to the teacher’s. Secondly the negative perception of teachers on teachers transfer has affect ed   teacher performance in a school. Thirdly, the transfer of overstayed teachers has both negative   and positive effect on teacher performance.         The study made the following conclusions; teacher transfers do exist in the studied schools   with a transfer  policy and being carried out by the Ministry of Education in Zambia. Transfers   in schools are liked by teachers since they increase on teachers’ innovativeness, flexibility at   work and also enables them to participate more in school activities which impro ves their   performance .Also teachers who overstay in the same school are demoralized, get used to   unchanged environment which creates lack of innovativeness and thus declining teacher   performance.  The researcher recommended that the transfers of teacher s  should be handled   fairly by the Ministry of Education; teachers should be encouraged to form associations in   schools or of the former members of their schools so as to be able to keep track of their friends   in case of transfers.     Finally, there should be stipulated duration any teacher is likely at least   to spend at any station or school. This will assist in eliminating the problem of overstayed   transfers which is creating discontentment among teachers in schools            \n",

God is at home, it's we who have gone out for a walk.    The price of inaction is far greater than the cost of making a mistake.    Over and above, I thank God for the sufficient grace and strength throughout this PhD   Journey.

I pray the “thank you”  prayer every day of my life for the abundant blessings that I have   received. Yet, it somehow does  not seem to be enough to only say \"thank you\" to those I am   about to recognise.    I am greatly indebted to my sole supervisor Dr Daniel Ndhlovu for providing me with   guidance, encouragement, wisdom and constructive criticism throughout this academic   journey .  My supervisor was indeed my mentor as he made me realise that though the   undertaking seemed impossible it was feasible.  I stumbled many times along the pathway,   and yet he made me realise that I needed to pick up the pieces and journey on. As I travell ed   with this scholar, my mentor, I began to realise that actually it was more about the learning   process than the destination.

            "v      ABSTRACT    The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of distant marriages on families amo ng   teachers in Mazabuka, Zambia . In order to assess the impact of distant  marriages on families   among  teachers in selected schools in Mazabuka, four objective s guided this study that is;  To   assess the prevalence of distan ce marriages in study district,  establish factors that might have   led to distance marriages in the stud y district, to assess the psychological impact of distant   marriages on famili es of teachers in the district and finally t o ascertain measures that ought to   be taken to reduce on the psychologica l impacts of distance marriages.  Four main components   of family focused on this study were; couples relationship, psychological  impact, parenting,   finances  and c ommunication.    This study adopted a descriptive survey research design.  The target po pulation comprised of   teachers and families  of teachers . In this study a non -random sampling procedure known as   Purposive sampling was appropriate used to select the Head t eacher’s , Teachers, families of   teachers in the targeted schools of M azabuka district.  10 Head teachers  were randomly selected   using simple random sampling, 20 Primary and Secondary  school class teachers  and 10   families of teachers.  A total sample of 40 respondents were selected. School class teachers and   families of teachers  randomly selected while head teachers were purposively selected.   Questionnaires , interview guide, focused group discussions  were  used to collect data.    In this   study  the qualitative and quantitative data that was collected was coded using thematic analysis   to ensure fast and efficient processing and identification of themes. The data collected in this   research was also analyzed using excel. Findings were presented by use of percentages, tables,   and pie charts.    Three main fa ctors contributed to distant marriages am ong teachers were employment ,   economic  factor and career advancement . Specifically the absence of a spouse impacted   negatively on a couples sexual relati onship s, where most o f the  responde nts were sexually   unfulfilled , others were emotionally dist ant with absent spouse while others cited the existence   of infidelity in the family  and frequent conflicts . Children who were significant members of   the family were equally affe cted by the absence of a  parent . Financial pressures and   communication  were aspects of a family affected  by absence of spouse/parent as recorded by   the respondents . Respondents indicated that issuing of transfers to couples involved in distance   marriages can be one solution that can reduce the increase in distance marriages.    The conclu sion of this study was that distance marriage is an emotional issue that needs to   address using the measures mentioned above by the relevant authori ty.   Based on the findings , the following recommendations were made; improvement on transfer   systems, the need to train more teachers, during postings teachers should be given opportunities   to choose were to be posted, teachers should be allowed to seek the aid of on or off-base social   service and finally families should prepare for experiences in distance marriages by attending   counselling.  Further , students should be conducted focusing on the absent spouse and singles   in long distance relationships.  \n",

Primary data   collection methods were carried out by the use of a questionnaire as a research instrument.    Secondary data was collected by t he perusing of various documents.  The research study took the   case study research design and where the sample comprised of one hundred and fifty respondents.   A pilot study was conducted to ascertain if the questionnaire was giving the desired results.    Findings of the research study revealed t hat Product Advertising has no effect  on consumer buying   behavior for medical students at Copperbelt University. Though advertising may play a  significant   role in affecting  consumers buying behavior by providing awaren ess, Interest, Desire, and Action,   advertising failed to have an effect  the buying behavior. The intervening variables affected the   dependent variable to the effect that it affecte d the outcome of the research study.       Despite advertising providing medical students with awareness, interest, and desire, it is evident   that medical students failed to purchase the product confirming that Product Advertising does not   positively affect consumer buying behavior . The null hypot hesis was accepted as the confidence   levels of five per cent were not attained.

            " 6a previous birth are at an increased risk of low bi rth weight (LBW), infection and   death. 17,21,52  When women have the  ability to space their birth s, they are better able to   recover from nutritional depletion, blood loss and reproductive system damage. This   enables them to have healthier children.      Research has confirmed the beneficial effects of fa mily planning on maternal and child   health.  Women’s use of safe and effective contrace ption helps reduce maternal mortality   and morbidity by reducing the number of high-risk p regnancies and births, and helps   lower child mortality by reducing the number of hig h-risk births. 18,50       1.3.2  Male Involvement      Men are frequently blamed for many of women’s repro ductive health problems.  They are   potential partners in and advocates for good reprod uctive health. However, family   planning programmes in the past have focused on wom en instead of men. Some of the   reasons for this scenario are that women bear the r isks and burdens of pregnancy and   childbearing, and that most modern contraceptives a re for women. 16 Other family   planning programmes have avoided men because they a ssume that men are indifferent or   even opposed to family planning. 14,28,32,34,47.                 Although women are using contraceptives, the method s that require male involvement        (such as condoms, periodic abstinence, withdrawal a nd vasectomy) are less used. 23    Traditionally, wives in the African society conside r their husbands as overall heads.

            " vi      ABSTRACT    Introduction: Early diagnosis of HIV ( Human Immunodeficiency Virus)  among   exposed infants gives an opportunity for early access to HIV care and treatment with   potential for i ncreased survival. Despite global efforts to scale up early infant diagnosis   (EID) services, in resource -limited, high HIV burden countries including Tanzania, the   coverage is still lower than the recommended levels.  The study was carried out to   determine HIV prevalence and factors associated with accessibility of EID among HIV   exposed under five -year children  in Muheza district, Tanzania.    Methods: A concurrent mixed methods design  comprising of cross sectional survey,   health facility survey and case study  design was conducted among mother/ guardian -  child pairs of HIV exposed child  and health care providers at Muheza health facilities   between June 2015 to June 2016 . Information on HIV status, socio -demographic and   other relevant data was collected using structured questionnaires, interview guides and   health facility checklist. Multiple regression analyses were done by using STATA   version 13.0 to examine the factors associated with accessibility to EID. Thematic   generation and analysis were done using Nvivo ve rsion 10.    Results: A total of 576 HIV exposed children with their respective mothers/guardians   were recruited. Of the 576 mothers/guardians, 549 (95.3%) were the biological mothers   with a median age of 34 years (inter -quartile range (IQR):30 to 38 years). The median   age of the 576 children was 15 months (IQR: 8.5 to 38.0 months). A total of 251   (43.6%) children were born to mothers with unknown HIV status at conception. Only   329 (57.1%) children accessed EID between four and six weeks of age. In the distric t,   EID testing sites were only available in 61% of health facilities. Children born to   mothers with unknown HIV status at conception (AOR=0.6, 95% CI 0.4 -0.8) and those   with ages 13 -59 months (AOR=0.4, 95% CI 0.2 -0.6) were the significant factors of   missed  opportunity to access EID. Children living with the head of household with at   least a high education level had higher odds of accessing EID (AOR= 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 -  3.3). Their likelihood of accessing EID services was three -fold higher among    mothers/guardian s with good knowledge of HIV infection prevention of mother to child   transmission (PMTCT)  (AOR=3.2, 95% CI 2.0 -5.2) than those with poor knowledge.   Mothers/guardians living in rural areas had poorer knowledge of PMTCT (AOR=0.6,   95% CI 0.4 -0.9) than those living in urban areas. According to qualitative interviews,   barriers identified to influence EID access at individual level included inadequate \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT    Not so long ago, P hysical Education (PE)  in Zambia was a subject which was   compulsorily taught and it enjoyed a status just like any other subject in the school   curriculum. Although this subject enjoyed compulsory status in all schools at that t ime,   it is hard to establish if it was  taught as such. In its attempt to revive PE, government   through its  2013 Educational Curriculum Framework introduced Academic as well as    Vocational Career Pathway Subjects . PE was made a Vo cational Career Pathway   Subject in this curriculum. PE had  become an optional career pathway subject. This   situation had seen very few schools choosing PE as a career pathway subject and this   became a concern. Thus, the study sought to establish the factors affecting the teaching   of PE in secondary schools. The p articipants included Standards Officers, lecturers,   head teachers, PE teachers and PE students. Data was collected through questionnaires,   semi -structured face -to-face interview schedules  and observation checklist s. From these   experiences, the study establ ished the status of PE in schools, the challenges teachers   faced in the teaching of the subject and strategies which they (teachers) used to cope   with the challenges.    It is no secret that physical activity is necessary to a person‟s well -being because it h as   immense benefits. The findings suggested that development of healthy young bodies   was one of the benefits of a school program me of PE. PE program mes in schools   directly benefited students‟ physical health, improved academic performance, promoted   healthy  lifestyle, increased self -esteem and taught life skills. Therefore, it was   important that students in schools engaged in PE activities owing to the many benefits   associated with the subject.    The results also revealed that the status of PE as a subject was  very low compared to   other subjects in the school curriculum and so was that of its teachers against other   subject teachers. The introduction of new subjects into the already crowded curriculum   had seen PE and other non -academic (lower status) subjects lo se teaching time to   accommodate these newer subjects. The study also revealed that there were many   challenges which PE teachers faced in their teaching of PE and these included an   overcrowded National and PE curricula, lack of PE resources, lack or bad sta te of   facilities and equipment, large classes, and negative attitude by parents, head teachers   and non PE teachers.  \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT       Since 2002, the Government of Zambia has been funding a farmer input support programme   (FISP) in order to increase household food security and incomes. The program specifies that   beneficiaries will collect subsidised inputs from the program for three (3) farming seasons   only and graduate ther eafter but however, no beneficia ry has ever graduated to date. The   purpose of this study was to establish the reasons for failure to graduate from the FISP by   small scale famers of Ilume agriculture camp of Mkushi district. The specific objectives of   this study are to establish the farmer‟s awareness of FISP graduation pathways; to establish   the farm management practices among beneficiaries that would lead to self -sufficie ncy and   surplus production and  finally to investigate the sufficiency  of inputs receiv ed by each FISP   beneficiary.  A qualitative approach was used and a  purposive sampling procedure was  used   to select three (3) Ministry of Agriculture camp officers, while a  snow bow technique was    used to identify 40 small scale farmers who have benefited from the input programme for   four years and above  since there is was no  sampling frame.  Interview guides were used  for   MoA  officials while t hree (3) Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were  held with f armers.    Semi - structured questionnaires were also administered to  individual farmers.  Thematic   content analysis was used to analyse the data , while  Microsoft excel was also used to come   up with tables and charts for data presentation.  The results of the study show that FISP   beneficiaries were not aware of any graduation pathways and conventional farming methods   were  the most popular among which was  in contradiction to the highly recommended   conservation farming methods . The results also show ed that each F ISP beneficiary receive   one pack consisting of 2 x 50kgs of basal fertilizer, 2 x 50kgs of urea fertilizer and 1 x 10kgs   of hybrid maize seed  which are not sufficient . The study concluded that the possible reasons   FISP beneficiaries do not graduate are tha t they are not aware of any graduation pathways;   the lack of use of best farming methods have led to perpetual low yields and the insufficient   quantities of inputs each farmer re ceive was  only enough for food security , but not enough  to   lead farmers to inc reased incomes and pov erty reduction. This led the FISP  not to achieve the   objective of household food security, improved incomes and poverty reduction in full.  The   study recommended that beneficiaries should be made awa re of graduation pathways while   the use of conservation farming techniques should not only be recommended, but should be   made mandatory to all benefiting farmers. The study also recommended that the government   should consider increasing the inputs for each farmer to 2 times the current quant ities. This   will make farmers achieve the FISP objective s thereby leading to graduation.  \n",

Phonemic awareness is the ability to distinguish an d manipulate the individual sounds   of language. This skill is critical for children wh o are still learning how to read.   Reading Comprehension is a complex cognitive proces s in which a reader intentionally   and interactively engages with the text. It is heav ily dependent on skilled word   recognition and decoding, oral reading fluency, a w ell-developed vocabulary and active   engagement with the text. If a learner has not yet reached this stage mentioned above,   then, he/she may encounter difficulties in reading and comprehending a text.   One of the aspects of reading comprehension is flue ncy. The ability to read fluently is   one of several critical factors necessary for readi ng comprehension. If a reader is not   fluent, it may be difficult to remember what she/he  has read and to relate the ideas   expressed in the text to his or her background know ledge. This accuracy and   automaticity of reading serves as a bridge between decoding and comprehension.   Another critical aspect of reading comprehension is  vocabulary development. When a   reader encounters an unfamiliar word in print and d ecodes it to derive its spoken   pronunciation, the reader understands the word bett er, especially  if it is in the reader's    mother tongue or familiar language. Otherwise, the reader must derive the meaning of   the word using another strategy, such as context, w hich is still very remote for most   grade three readers. (Even to university students)   Rapid automatized naming is the ability to quickly recognise and say out the names of   letters, objects and colours, and this predicts an individual's ability to read. It might be   linked to the importance of quick retrieval of phon ological representations from long   term memory in reading.    Phonics is a teaching method that stresses the acqu isition of letter-sound   correspondences and their use in reading and spelli ng. It helps beginning readers   understand how letters are linked to sounds (phonem es), patterns of letter-sound   correspondences and spelling, and how to apply this  knowledge when they read.   Although phonic work is necessary it is important t o note that on its own it is not \n",

            "v    which the syllabus was moved. I t was  establishe d that the policy was not useful to low ability   learners  as it promoted failing  especially to the  illiterate learners and it also  contributed  to   low standards of  education .    In this study  it was  recommended that the MoGE should  stop automatic grade seven   progression to grade eight and re -introduce a reasonable cut off point for grade seven   selection to grade eight to ensure that  learners with  at least with a certain level of a bility and   knowledge enter secondary  school . It was also recommended that in order to effectively    progress learners , the government should consider the ability, literacy and knowledge levels   of the learner.     The conclusion was  that automatic progression affected learner performance. Most   progressed learners were found to be illiterate in English which contributed to poor academic   performance. The policy contributed to the low learner morale and self -esteem. Most   automatic progr essed learners were found to be passive in class with less hope to progress to   senior secondary school due failure to get concepts. It also contributed to high enrolment in   the classes which hindered chance and time for teachers to give each individual lea rner   attention and use of variety of teaching methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

There have been a number of communication breakdown s between EHCAAC   management and the students.  This has usually led to poor relationships as   evidenced by student class boycotts and demonstrati ons.  These have usually   been violent and in turn tarnished the image of the  institution.  The effective   provision of the goods and services has also been n egatively affected.  This is   evidenced by student complaints on the quality of s ervices received (Djokotoe,   2009:20).      In order for higher institutions of learning to ach ieve their mission of providing   the much needed skilled manpower and contributing t o the social, economic and   political development of their countries and the wo rld at large, there is need for   effective communication strategies.

            "v    ABSTRACT       This research study sought to assess head teachers‟ management of Home -Grown School   Feeding Programme  in selected primary schools in Chipata District. The study was guided   by three objectives: To determine head teachers management of HGSFP in primary   schools, to establish strategies used by head teachers in resource mobilization for HGSFP   and to examine c hallenges faced by head teachers in management of HGSFP. Data was   collected using, interviews, and observation check list. Data was analyzed thematically.   The study sample was 46, comprising 15 head teachers, 15 SHN coordinators, 15 parents   and 1 District school feeding manager. All the respondents were purposively sampled   because they were privy to study information. The study findings showed t hat head   teachers manage HGSFP by: initiating structures, spearheading com munity sensitization,   community mobilization for participation and programme monitoring and evaluation. The   study further revealed that head teachers established good strategies in resource   mobilization for HGS FP. The strategies were : employment of permanent cooks, engaging   in income gen erating activities, asking parents to buy feeding utensils for their children   and incorporation of parents in the school feeding committee. Lastly, the study established   that head teachers were faced with five major challenges in m anagement of HGSFP which   were:  pupils leaving feeding utensils at home, poor quality of fir e wood, absenteeism by   voluntary cooks, parents‟ negative attitude toward the programme and time management .   The study concluded that head teachers deployed good practices and strategies in   management of HGSFP which has led to the attainment of the desired benefits of the   school feeding programme in the district.    Based on the findings, the study made the follo wing recommendations:  the government   should ensure that there is proper and regular Home -grown school feeding programme in   all public primary schools in Chipata District. Government must also supplement the   efforts of the donors so that when they are no more school feeding continues to run. The   efforts of the donors must also be appreciat ed and complimented. School management   should support the programme by coming up with several ideas such as setting out income   generating activities that would keep the programme running in an event when there is   delayed funding from the donors. The Local community should educate parents on the   importance of sending the children to school and the importance of the programme itself.    Parents should support the feeding programme by providing labour in cooking, providing   fire wood, supplying their children wit h clean plastic cups for meals, sending their children   to school so that food is not put to waste and also by helping to pay the cooks. Donors   should step up the brands of food by introducing more than what is there i.e. introducing   other meals other than the porridge being provided, introduce other forms of fuel other   than firewood. Lastly, the spirit of volunteerism among beneficiary communities must be   encouraged by way of attaching an incentive to the work the volunteers do.  \n",

            "v       ABSTRACT    Despite low -income and middle -income countries (LMIC) being the regions o f the world   with the greatest gap in access to safe surgical and anaesthetic services, there are fewer   published data for these countries on perioperative mortality indices. Global trends are that   perioperative mortality has declined over the last five dec ades.  Zambia has had two   published studies over the last 30 years. The initial study conducted by Heywood, Wilson and   Sinclair in 1987 revealed an overall sixth day inpatient perioperative mortality rate (POMR)   of 7.55 per 1000 operations which was more t han three times the current rate of high income   countries. Surgical avoidable POMR was highest at 1.93 per 1000 operations, followed by   administrative avoidable POMR at 0.85 per 1000 operations and then anaesthetic avoidable   POMR lowest at 0.53 per 1000 op erations. Some of the recommendations from this study   resulted in the establishment of a trainining programme in anaesthesia and critical care, and   procurement of modern anaesthetic and monitoring equipment. It was the lack of more recent   knowledge to asce rtain whether the quality of the Zambian surgical and anaesthetic services   have improved in keeping with global trends that made it imperative to conduct a   perioperative mortality study in the largest teaching hospital in Zambia as a follow up to the   initial study.                                               Over a six months period we prospectively identified all patients who died within six days of   surgery, having undergone a surgical procedure by either a general, regional or combined   anaesthesia at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka. All demised patients had their   records analysed by a specialist surgeon and anaesthetist to determine factors contributing to   their death by consensus. The causes of death were classified as avoidable, partially   avoidable and unavoidable. The deaths categorised as avoidable and partially avoidable were   further categorised into contributing factors, namely anaesthetic, surgical, administrative   cause or a combination thereof.  The data on denomenator was collected from t he surgical and   recovery room registers. The numerator was the total number of all inpatient deaths within   six days of the surgical procedure, with date of surgery being day one.                                      A total of 9775 cases were captured with 4 49 of these being lost to follow up. The   denominator was therefore made of 9326 cases.  Seventy nine patients were detected to have   died during the study period. The overall sixth day inpatient perioperative mortality rate   (overall POMR) was found to be 0. 85% (95% CI: 0.68 -1.06)   and the sixth day inpatient   avoidable mortality rate (avoidable POMR) was found to be 0.42% (95% CI: 0.30 -0.57).  The   sixth day inpatient anaesthetic POMR, surgical POMR and administrative POMR were found   to be 0.04% (95% CI: 0.01 -0.079), 0.19% (95% CI: 0.12 -0.31) and 0.19% (95% CI: 0.12 -  0.31) respectively. Compared to the historical indices from 1987 by Heywood, Wilson and   Sinclair the chi -square test revealed a difference of no statistical significance (x2=0.411 with   1df, p=0.522 ). With regard to the 24 hour inpatient perioperative mortality indices, the   overall POMR was found to be 0.30% (95% CI: 0.21 -0.44). The 24hr inpatient avoidable   mortality rate (avoidable POMR) was 0.17% (95% CI: 0.10 -0.28). The 24hr inpatient   anaesthetic,  surgical and administrative avoidable POMR were 0.02% (95% CI: 0.00 -0.08),   0.07% (95% CI 0.03 -0.16) and 0.08% (95% CI: 0.03 -0.16)  respectively.                              The perioperative mortality indices at UTH have not reduced in comparison to the hi storical   data from 30 years ago. This is contrary to global indices which have shown a downward   trend over the last five decades.    Keywords:  perioperative, mortality, numerator, denominator, avoidable  \n",

            "6    Abstract   The objectives of the study were to identify the so urces and patterns of stress among basic school tea chers   and to compare the severity of stress among basic s chool teachers based on gender.  The study further   investigated the coping mechanisms adopted by teach ers to deal with stress. The study adopted a survey    methodology.    Questionnaires and Focus Group Discussions were use d to collect data. One hundred and fifty teachers   were randomly selected in 15 basic schools in Lusak a Urban districts. Quantitative data was analyzed   using SPSS Version 16. Qualitative data was analyze d using content analysis techniques. The study   covered only Lusaka Urban Basic Schools thus limiti ng the scope and extent to which the findings could    be generalized.   The study has established the existence of stress a mong basic school teachers in Lusaka urban district .   The findings have revealed that there were four maj or categories of stressors among Basic School   teachers, namely: poor conditions of service such a s lack of accommodation, low salaries, and difficul ties   of getting entitlements; poor school climate, for e xample, discriminatory tendencies among school   managers; heavy workload, for instance handling ove rcrowded classes and handling of more than one   session; low esteem among staff (including lack of recognition from the general public, work not   rewarding, and lack of regard for qualification).  The findings of this study suggest that the greate st   sources of stress among teachers in Lusaka region w ere conditions of service especially those   related to emoluments, for example, low salaries an d lack of accommodation. Another major   source of stress suggested by the study was work re lated situations, involving interruptions to   school programs, heavy workload, and overcrowded cl asses and so on     The major coping strategies used by teachers inclu ded engaging in extra activities to raise money to meet   accommodation costs, and soliciting for support fro m peers to deal with discriminatory tendencies by   administrators. The implication of these findings i s that teachers will exhibit multiple symptoms such  as   absenteeism, frequent permissions, low working mora le just to mention but a few all of which will affe ct   pupil performance.     The study therefore recommends that the Government of the Republic of Zambia should improve   teachers’ condition of service and working environm ents. It is further recommended that basic school   teachers should be provided with extra curriculum a ctivities and internet facilities to keep them   entertained. \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT       This study  examined  the ca uses of operational stress in  soldiers, ad verse effects, and assessed  the   role of counselling  in reducing operational s tress in soldiers in  Kabwe.  Zambia . Stress and   stressors are an inherent part of warfare because of the violence, the physical conditions, and   duration of operations. Stress represents “the mobilization ” of the body and mind to co unteract   stressors. The causes of stress will always be there as long as soldiers are deployed  in an   environment which is a br eeding ground, for example during operation s in battle front and   prolonged operation and other factors . Early identifica tion of st ressors and adverse effects can   minimize  the negative effects of c ombat and operational s tress (COS). Adverse refers to   physical, mental, and emotional manifestations; loss of personne l due to combat ineffectiveness .   The study therefore, was aimed at findi ng ways of reducing stress. With the following objectives:   to determine the causes; determine the adverse effect of operational stress and assess the role of   counselling in reducing operational stress in soldiers at Chindwin and Kohima barracks, the   study  revealed that counseling is one of the measures which can minimize the high le vels of   operational stress in  soldiers deployed and after, if incorporated in the training programmes by   utilizing the services of the professional chaplains and medical personne l.  A descriptive survey   was used in conducting the research. Collection of data was done by interviewing a sample   population of 50 participants and by use of questionnaires. Qualitative method was employed to   collect data. Qualitative research emphasizes understanding of verbal narratives. The method   was used because participants were met at once hence it saved  on time.  The participants asserted   that counseling can play a vital role through the services of military chaplain  counselors and   mental health pr ofessionals in Operational S tress cont rol for prevention, identification,   counseling therapy and treatment . Through questionnaires and interviews it was established that   those who were counseled received help than those who did not. In this case pro counse ling must   be extended even when the soldiers are out of stressful field in order to prevent unusual behavior   such as extremely d rug/alcohol abuse, in dulge in s exuality , malingering, absenteeism without   official leave, marital problems, financial indiscipli ne just to  mention a few.           \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT    Human taeniasis  is an internal parasitic disease associated with the handling, prepar ing, and consuming    infected beef or pork with viable cysts. However, the association between exposures to infections and   causal factors varies from person to person. Numerous factors are  responsible for exposure which may   be linked to the socio -economic status of the society, the geographical location of the country or   environment, the level of awareness of the society and the health system of a country to combat such   diseases. Economic a nd cultural conditions may contribute to perpetuating exposure to the disease. The   risk of exposure an d infection may  be reduced by r outine meat inspection . This study aimed to assess   the risk of human exposure to Taenia saginata  through beef consumption.    To achieve this objective, a three -tier study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of T. saginata in   slaughtered cattle, describe the beef consumption pattern among residents in Windhoek, and quantify   the risk of human exposure through beef consumption . The first study was  a retrospective review of   meat inspection records at a selected abattoir to estimate  prevalence. The second part was  a cross -  sectional survey to  gather beef consumptio n data from the study population . The final part of the study    used primary data inputs and the consumption survey to estimate the risk of exposure to Cysticercus    bovis  and possible risk factors contributing to the risk of exposure using Monte Carlo simulation -based   in the @Risk software embedded  in Microsoft Excel. Resear ch ethics was considered and applied in all   aspects.    The prevalence of bovine cysticercosis was  0.70% among the inspected beef carcasses. Beef consumers   were estimated to be 99.5% of the population . The majority consumed  40-50g pieces in a serving, with   the largest portion being 300g per serving. The number of cysts that could be found in a 300g portion of   beef was 5 (95% CI 1 -11). The probability of  human exposure  to T. saginata  was 0.0076%. Although   the risk of exposure  increased with the absence of home freezing of beef  and Post Mortem Inspection   (PMI) by  0.0094% and  0.109% , respectively , improving home fr eezing  and routine  PMI may reduce the   risk of exposure to  0.0038% and 0.0040% , respectively . Hence PMI and home freezing we re both   protective and contri buting factors to the risk of  exposure    The probability  of C. bovis viability after home freezing of beef and  C. bovis  viability in infected beef    after cooking were the most influencing risk factors. Therefore, i mproving home freezing, efficient PMI   and tho rough cooking of beef  coupled with one he alth approach are recommended  to reduce the risk . \n",

            "v    ABST RACT    Zambia has been making strides to uphold  some democratic principles such as having   periodic and competitive elections, respect for human rights and respect for  the rule of law   to mention just a few. The study was aimed at investigating causes and esta blishing the   effects of the 2016 general election conflict which erupted in Namwala District of Southern   province, as well as to devise possible measures to mitigate the electoral conflict.    The study approach utilised was qualitativ e and the research desig n was case study, making   it a qualitative case study research.  For the purpose of obtaining desired re sults, the   researcher used semi -structured interview guide for the village headmen/women   respondents and focus group discussions for the youths who were t he key informants.   Qualitative research was applied because it is effective in soliciting information about   values, opinions and mores of a given demography.    Research findings reviewed  that post-electoral conflict  is caused by ethnicity, gr eedy and   demogra phy. These causes however, are so devastating that they lead to a destabilised   society. Electoral conflicts has effects such as destruction of both public and private   property, loss of plant, animal and human life and also leads to environmental degradatio n.    This entails that there is need for consented efforts by the officers and regulations for   conducting elections or otherwise the situation may be more violent as compare to the   previou s elections.    In conclusion, the study revealed the possible measures to the challenge of electoral   conflicts which includes enhancing civic and voter education, discouragement of regional   politics and political corruption which is a bad practice in a democratic government and   institution and law reforms to suit the current situation of elections in the country.    Electoral conflicts are very detrimental to development but at times may bring about   positive change in an institution or government.

Without the ability, streng th, and wellbeing of me and my family,   this work would have been but a dream. Thank you, a lmighty God, for having given me the   grace to take one day at a time.   I also owe sincere and heartfelt gratitude to my su pervisor, Dr. Ecloss Munsaka, for his   tireless efforts in reading and re-reading my many revisions from the very beginning of the   research process, throughout and to this very end.  Sir, you kept me going by way of asking   very insightful questions and offering invaluable a dvice that made this work possible.  I can   only ask my God, who never fails, to richly bless y ou.   I truly consider it an honour for having been a par taker of the knowledge and experience of   the different lecturers on the course; for opening up new avenues of knowledge in the area of   Literacy and Learning. To Dr. Luangala, Mr. Chakani ka, Dr. Banda, Mr. Nkosha, Dr.   Cheyeka, Dr Simwiinga, Dr. Mwansa and Dr. Matafwali  I say thank you.    Thanks to the University of Zambia for providing th e necessary material support.   I cannot find the words to express my gratitude to my beloved husband Mubanga Ng’ona for   enduring the long process with me and always offeri ng love and support. Thank you for ever   being so understanding.    This work would not have been possible without the  love and support of my only beloved   son Mapalo. Many thanks to you son for having perse vered with me and always patient about   my not fulfilling promises I made due to time facto r. Your enquiries after my progress with   this work always inspired me to go on. The sky, for  you, my dear, is not the limit. Be the best   you can be.     I would like to thank my dearest daughter Bupe, fo r inspiring as well as spurring me on by   your actions which imitated mine. Each time I was b usy writing and enquired of your   whereabouts, you would shout from your room that yo u were writing your ‘dissertation’. I   pray that you will grow up to be the prolific write r and avid reader you have shown at five!

Additionally, I also want to thank y ou so much, my angel, for providing me   with vivid and concrete examples of Emergent Litera cy.    Finally, I am indebted to my colleagues for having  offered encouragement and support   always urging me on when it mattered most.

The study results also show that, there is lack of knowledgeabout policy contents   anda weak legal frame work. Furthermore, institutio ns are ill equipped and are   thereforenon-operational. There is a negative attit ude by implementers (local   government practitioners) towards the policy.These are the major constraints in the   implementation of the policy.       From the above findings, the study recommends that central government should   provide adequate information to all stakeholders on  the implementation of the policy.   Use of major local languages in information dissemi nation on decentralization   processes should be considered. Government should s trengthen the legal framework   that supports implementation of the policy. Adequat e resources, human, financial and   material should be provided to institutions involve d in the implementation process to   make them operational. The ministry of local govern ment and housing should   motivate, educate and train local government practi tioners to make their attitude   towards implementation of the policy positive.

            "v | Page    ABSTRACT   Background   Of the estimated 130 million infants born each year worldwide, 4 million die in the first 28   days of life illustrating how neonatal mortality accounts for al most 40 percent of under-five   child mortality, globally. The continued loss of infants within the first month of life results   from a complex chain of socio-economic, biol ogical and healthcare-related factors. We   examined factors that may be associated with neonatal mortality in Zambia.  Materials and Methods   Using a  cross-sectional design, data were extracted from the 2007 ZDHS Women's   Questionnaire for respondents aged 15-49 year s in the selected households. Women who   reported having given birth to live infants with in the five years preceding the survey were   included as the study population but only those infants who could have lived through the first   month (28 days) were assessed.  Results   A total number of 6 435 live-born infants within the five years preceding the survey were extracted as the study population. Of these birt hs, 219 (3.4%) neonatal deaths were recorded.   Low birth weight  and overweight were reporte d as the prominent factors .The odds of dying   were significantly higher for infants with low birth weight compared to infants born with   normal weight, (aOR=2.58, 95% CI 1.02-6.49).  The pattern was the same in both rural   though insignificant. Over weight born babies were also associated with increased odds of dying (aOR 3.21, CI 1.36-7.59) compared to normal sized born babies. Compared to infants   born from Mothers with no education, infants born from mothers with at least secondary   school and higher were associated with increased odds of dying (aOR 3.55, CI 95%, 1.26-  9.94). Mother’s age at birth also showed some  relationship with neonatal mortality. Babies   born to Mothers in the age group 18-24 years had reduced odds of dying than babies born to   those in the age group 12- 17 years.           \n",

            "iv    ABSTRACT       This is a st udy whose aim was to establish the nature and causes of examination malpractices in selected   secondary schools in Kitwe District. The Examination Council of Zambia has placed a high premium on   examinations. D espite the high premium placed on examinations, examination malpractice  are still on   the increase. The aim of the study was to bring out the nature and ca uses of examination malpractice .   A descriptive design was  used. Data collection included the use of in - depth in terviews with an   education  standards  officer  at DEBS office and school managers while focus group discussions were   used for learners. Questionnaires were also used for teachers and learners. The sample for the study was   one hundred and forty eight ( 148 ) which was disaggregated as follows; on e hundred and twelve ( 112)    grade twelve  learners, twenty eight ( 28 ) teachers, seven ( 7 )  school managers and one ( 1 ) education   standards officer ( ESO ) from Kitwe district. Quantitative data was analysed using the statistical   package for social sci ences (SPSS) while qualitative data was analysed thematically.    The study revealed that the nature of examination malpractice  includes; leakage , imperso nation, taking   foreign material  into the examination room, collusion, body writing or tattooing , hiding m aterial in   washrooms, taking in already answered scripts and replacing them with the answer script given to them,   giraffing and text messages and borrowing of stored material using cell phones.    This study highlights  the reasons for examination malpract ice which includes learners  desire to pass the   examinations , lack of confidence, fear of failure, worry of failing to get a certificate, the emphasis on   obtaining a certificate to get a job, improper guidance by teachers to face examinations, frequ ent   absente eism and laziness.    Generally, the st udy revealed that both boys and girls engage themselves in examination malpractices   because they all want to pass. Notably, both government and private schools engage themselves in   examination malpractice. Furthermore, the study also revealed that learners from both high socio -   economic background and  low socio - economic background engage  in examination malpractice .    In order to address examination malpractice,  it was  recommended that  schools  should  conduct    intensified s ensitisat ion to both teachers and learners. It was  also recommended that the Ministry of   Education, Science, Vocational Training and Early Education (MESVTEE) through the standards   officers and school managers should intensify monitoring in order to ensure  quality delivery of lessons   so as to develop confidence in learners and also ensure that school based continuing professional   development (SB - CPD) is enhanced so that teachers share knowledge on how to teach the seemingly   challenging topics. This should be done to help learners understand what they are learning and in the end   develop confidence for them to write examinations. The other recommendations included staff and   student awareness campaigns and workshops to highlight the importance  of the integrit y of the   education system and also to stiffen and enforce security policies.  \n",

CONCLUSION :  The study established that the difference in the G6PD deficiency prevalence   rates was not statistically significant at 0.05 significance  level ( p=0.13). Therefore, the results   support the hypothesis that states  that there is no difference in G6PD deficiency prevalence   between the essential hypert ensive and normotensive adults, though the study showed a possible   role of G6PD deficiency in t he pathophysiology of essential hypertension.

            "   6    ABSTRACT   This presentation provides a summary of the study e ntitled ‘Factors leading to low levels of   participation in Adult literacy programmes among me n in Namwala District.   The purpose of the study was to establish the facto rs leading to low levels of participation in   Adult literacy programmes among men in Namwala Dist rict.   The study had two main objectives with the overall objective being to identify factors which   lead to low levels of participation in adult litera cy programmes among men in Namwala   District. The specific objectives were: to establis h why men enrolled into adult literacy   programmes; and to identify factors that inhibit me n from participating in adult literacy   programmes.   The study employed  a case study design. Semi-struc tured questionnaires and interview   guides were used to collect quantitative and qualit ative data. The sample size was 200   respondents as follows: 1 District Commissioner; 7 government departmental heads; 12   facilitators; 5 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) comp rising 6 men in each FGD, bringing the   total number of participants in the FGDs to 30; 50 non-participants and 100 participants.   The study established that both basic and functiona l literacy were being offered and that men   engaged in the programmes so that they could, among  other things, be able to read and write   and also improve their farming and livestock manage ment skills. It was further revealed that   some men chose not to take part in the adult litera cy programmes because they felt shy, felt   they were too old for any learning and that the pro grammes were a waste of time. The study   recommended that the government constructs infrastr ucture specifically for adult literacy   programmes and also that the providers of adult lit eracy programmes embark on sensitisation   activities of adult literacy programmes.                   \n",

Interpersonal/face  to  face  communication  is  what  Kaloko  Trust  Z ambia  has  been    predominantly using in bringing change in lives in the communities. According to the    respondents, it has had tremendous effects by helping communities get vital services. These    include clean water and sanitation, infrastructural develop ment provision and support to    education and health, promoting sustainable agriculture, preservation of the environment    through natural community resources and improved livelihoods through community trainings    in IGAs in communities.    The communities appr aised the interventions as helpful and the communication strategies as   contextual and serving purpose. The respondents also said the interventions promoted   consultation and participation.                                                                      iii  \n",

The study used   questionnaires, focus group schedules, and semi-str uctured interviews to collect data from the   field. The main respondents in this study were sele cted grade twelve secondary school pupils.   However, information was also collected from teache rs and Headteachers.    The objectives of the study were to evaluate levels  of pupils’ understanding of environmental   sustainable development, determine the availability  and viability of environmental awareness   programmes as well as to establish the challenges f aced by secondary schools in carrying out   environmental awareness.   The study revealed that environmental awareness lev els towards sustainable development in   schools was quite poor. Pupils did not have enough information on environmental related issues,   especially towards sustainable development because of lack of environmental programmes in   their respective schools. Results from this study a lso revealed that environmental programmes in   schools were largely very few and not viable becaus e of lack of funds, reluctance from both   learners and their teachers coupled with the absenc e of well spelt government interventions.   Schools faced numerous challenges in their quest to  try to improve environmental awareness and   the major challenges revealed in this study were th ose of lack of transport, environmental   materials such as magazines and above all lack of f unds in schools to supportenvironmental   excursions for pupils.    Based on the findings stated above, the following recommendations have been made.   Government should design programmes that would moti vate the teaching of environmental   issues such as introduction of compulsory environme ntal education subject. The practical part of   pupils’ learning, which was discovered to be very l ow in this study should be encouraged since it   would inculcate, develop and raise positive environ mental perceptions, values, attitudes and   skills in pupil. Environmental issues, the world ov er, have become bedrock of sustainable   development with emphasis on the young ones. There is therefore, unwavering need to design an   education system that would support sustainable dev elopment to prevent natural resources   depletion. \n",

The objectives of this study were to, evaluate the efficacy of the roles of civil society   organizations in peace building , investigate the extent to which civil society organisation s   engage youths and political players in peac e building activities , assess people‟s perception s on   the roles of civil society organisations and to determine the chall enges that civil society   organis ations face in peace building in the Republic of Zambia. Both questionnaires and   interview guides  were used to collect information from the respondents. Questionnaires were   used to collect information from students  in three selected higher learning institution s and bus   drivers as well as  marketers. Q ualitative and quantitative methods were used to analyse the   findings . Quantitative method was used to present the findings collected using questionnaires   while qualitative method was used to analyse the find ings collected using interviews and focus   group discussions.     This study revealed that the three church mother bodies  play various roles in peace building  in   Zambia. These roles include  acting as inter -mediation and facilitation, advocates for citizens‟   human rights and promote inter -group social cohesion in peace building process. This study al so   revea led that the majority people in Zambia were  not involved in peac e building. The study also   revealed  that the majority  political leaders were not showing interest of working together with   the three church mother bodies in peace building in the country. It was also revealed in this study    that civil society organisations face different challenges in promoting peace in the country which   included,  being p erceived as political partisan a ssociation s, lack of willingness by pol itical   leaders to work with Civil Soci ety O rganisations  (CSO)  in peace building programmes and   financial challenges  in Zambia.        \n",

            "vi    Abstract    Heavy metal contamination commonly results  from human activities such as mining, and it has    become a serious environmental problem . Heavy metals are an important category of the industrial   pollutants due to their non -biodegradability. One of the most cost-effective  strategies for dealing   with hea vy metal contamination is p hytoremediation . Phytoremediation is a general term for using   plants to remove or degrade different kinds of soil pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides and   landfill leachates . In Kabwe, Lead pollution arising from the Lead and Zinc mine tailing has   continued up to date because the erosion by wind and water of the tailing materials, has not been   remediated. This study evaluated the  potential of vetiver and lemon grass for use in   phytoremediation of lead (Pb) polluted soils.  Soil samples were collected from Kabwe mine   tailings and near the mine (Chowa community) for the pot experiments in Pb concentrations of 0   mg/kg , 720.5 mg/kg  865.5 mg/kg , 1510 mg/kg , 1551.8 mg/kg  and 1587.7 mg/kg . The test plants   (vetiver and lemongrass) were cut to uniform heights (lemongrass 10 cm and vetiver 13 cm ). The   treatments (Pb concentration) were replicated four times and the study was done  for 120 days .   Both vetiver and lemongrass  grew in all the Pb contaminated  and Pb -free soils. There was a   decrease in biomass yield with increase in soi l Pb concentrations (from 134.0 g in 0 mg/kg  to 64.3   g in 1587.7 mg/kg , and from 98.0. g in  0 mg/kg  to 52.1 g in 1587 mg/kg  for vetiver and lemon grass   respectively). Both  vetiver and  lemon grass  accumulated Pb  which  was more in the ro ots than the   shoots (P < 0.05, bioaccumulation factor <  1). Lemongrass  accumulated on average 0.73% Pb in   the roots, and 0.13%  Pb in the shoot. In contrast, vetiver grass took up  on average 0.4%  Pb in t he   roots and 0.29%  Pb in the shoots . The translocation factor was less than  1 for both vetiver and   lemongrass hence,  both plant types may not be suitable for phytoextraction but  for   phytostabilization and revegetation of the Pb contaminated tailings.

            "    v    ABSTRACT    This study exp lored the academic experie nces of  blind st udents in two colleges of education in   Zambia. It mainly investigated the nature of student induction programmes offered in colleges of   education , barriers affecting the education of blind s tudents in the two colleges of education  and   avail able suppor t provisions . The study employed an interpretative paradigm, qualitative method   and phenomenological design. Using purposive sampling, a total sam ple of fourteen (14)   participants; eight (8) blind students , four (4) college lecture rs for special  education and two (2)   college administrators were picked for the study. Semi-structured interview guides and   observation checklist s were used  to collect data.  The study established that the nature of   induction  programs offered to first -years students in t he two colleges of education was mainly in   twofold:  actuali sation of students to academic practices and general familiari sation of all students   to the college environment. Although the study established that actuali sation of students to   academic practices enlightened first -year learners to their academic life at the colleges, narratives   of discontentment were equally espoused concerning the inclusivity of the program in relation to   absence of induction handouts in differentiated formats and the inability of  the colleges to   separately familiari se blind students to the college environment and absence of O&M tra ining in   colleges of education.  The most pronounced academic hindrances ex perienced by blind students   were linked to inaccessible and unpredictable coll ege environment, difficulties in securing   sighted guides during blind students ’ stay in the colleges, the dilemmas of repeatedly making   individual follow -up of their written academic work, assessment dilemmas ; lack of assistive   technology and non -existence  of resource rooms.  The study recommended that the two colleges   of education should undertake separate familiari sation programmes for blind students during   first-year induction , Ministry of General Education should institute policy provisions that should   compel colleges of education to provide O&M training to blind students , need for colleges to   improve their physical learning environments and need to promote buddy system approach and   other appropriate support provisions.

            "v    ABSTRACT       This research study sought to assess head teachers‟ management of Home -Grown School   Feeding Programme  in selected primary schools in Chipata District. The study was guided   by three objectives: To determine head teachers management of HGSFP in primary   schools, to establish strategies used by head teachers in resource mobilization for HGSFP   and to examine c hallenges faced by head teachers in management of HGSFP. Data was   collected using, interviews, and observation check list. Data was analyzed thematically.   The study sample was 46, comprising 15 head teachers, 15 SHN coordinators, 15 parents   and 1 District school feeding manager. All the respondents were purposively sampled   because they were privy to study information. The study findings showed t hat head   teachers manage HGSFP by: initiating structures, spearheading com munity sensitization,   community mobilization for participation and programme monitoring and evaluation. The   study further revealed that head teachers established good strategies in resource   mobilization for HGS FP. The strategies were : employment of permanent cooks, engaging   in income gen erating activities, asking parents to buy feeding utensils for their children   and incorporation of parents in the school feeding committee. Lastly, the study established   that head teachers were faced with five major challenges in m anagement of HGSFP which   were:  pupils leaving feeding utensils at home, poor quality of fir e wood, absenteeism by   voluntary cooks, parents‟ negative attitude toward the programme and time management .   The study concluded that head teachers deployed good practices and strategies in   management of HGSFP which has led to the attainment of the desired benefits of the   school feeding programme in the district.    Based on the findings, the study made the follo wing recommendations:  the government   should ensure that there is proper and regular Home -grown school feeding programme in   all public primary schools in Chipata District. Government must also supplement the   efforts of the donors so that when they are no more school feeding continues to run. The   efforts of the donors must also be appreciat ed and complimented. School management   should support the programme by coming up with several ideas such as setting out income   generating activities that would keep the programme running in an event when there is   delayed funding from the donors. The Local community should educate parents on the   importance of sending the children to school and the importance of the programme itself.    Parents should support the feeding programme by providing labour in cooking, providing   fire wood, supplying their children wit h clean plastic cups for meals, sending their children   to school so that food is not put to waste and also by helping to pay the cooks. Donors   should step up the brands of food by introducing more than what is there i.e. introducing   other meals other than the porridge being provided, introduce other forms of fuel other   than firewood. Lastly, the spirit of volunteerism among beneficiary communities must be   encouraged by way of attaching an incentive to the work the volunteers do.  \n",

Research findings reviewed  that post-electoral conflict  is caused by ethnicity, gr eedy and   demogra phy. These causes however, are so devastating that they lead to a destabilised   society. Electoral conflicts has effects such as destruction of both public and private   property, loss of plant, animal and human life and also leads to environmental degradatio n.    This entails that there is need for consented efforts by the officers and regulations for   conducting elections or otherwise the situation may be more violent as compare to the   previou s elections.    In conclusion, the study revealed the possible measures to the challenge of electoral   conflicts which includes enhancing civic and voter education, discouragement of regional   politics and political corruption which is a bad practice in a democratic government and   institution and law reforms to suit the current situation of elections in the country.    Electoral conflicts are very detrimental to development but at times may bring about   positive change in an institution or government.

            "v       ABSTRACT    This abstract is based on a study carried out in Misisi ; an informal settlement in the city of   Lusaka. The settlement experiences perennial floods.  However, despite the frequency and   devasting effects of flooding in the area, people co ntinue to live in the settlement. In much of   urban Africa, adaptation to settlement flooding has been community -driven based on lived   experiences and the use of local resources and rudimental technologies. However, there has been   a contested debate regardi ng the value of local knowledge and experience in disaster risk   reduction for a wholesome flood adaptation response in African cities. Often viewed as   ‘backwards’, governments instead based on foreign  ideas have emphasized ‘advanced’ alien   technologically sophisticated and economically expensive approach es which are often non -  consultative and alien to local liv ing conditions. This study sought  to examine the rationalities   that influence the implementation of community -based adaptation strategies to mitigate  flooding   in Misisi. The aim was achieved by the following objectives: To investigate the role of   community governance systems for flood adaptation, to spatially map flood risk areas using   community and experiential knowledge, to identify community -driven adaptati on strategies and   to examine instances of differences between community and state approaches to urban flood risk   mitigation in Misisi. The study used a case study research approach . It was designed as a   descriptive and interpretive inquiry analysed  through a mixed  methods  approach . The study was   based on data purposively collected from 65 households and supplemented by 3 key informants   from state institutions with a stake in flood management and mitigation in the settlement. Key   methods employed in collecting  empirical evidence included semi -structured interviews with   flood -affected households , in-depth  interviews with  ward leaders, and state officials and   mapping of zones by the severity of flooding. Non -participant observation, primarily taking   photographs, complemented these methods. Data was analysed through descriptive statistics,   content and narrative analysis.  Spatial data were analysed using spatial modelling in GIS.    Findings show that the area Councillor, Ward Development Committee (WDC) and Zone   Representatives make up the main governance structure  in Misisi  which are responsible for   organising  the community to build community -based flood resilience systems. The study   identified t wo flooding zones namely low  and highly flooded based on geospa tial modelling and   the frequency of occurrence of urban flooding in the area . From a total of 4,965 houses  in Misisi,   64% of the houses fall in low flood risks areas, while 3 6% fall in high-risk areas. The community   has employed structural and non -structur e measures to adapt to floods. The most common   adaptation strategies used are the use of sandbags which are place d around their houses; raised   pit latrines and doorsteps; construction of embankments, small drainages, protection walls and   elevation of house  foundations and seasonal temporal displacement.  The research  findings  also   revealed that there is a lack of acceptance by the local government of local people’s knowledge   and their response to floods. This has resulted in conflicting rationalities between  state-led   approaches and the community. The conclusion emphas ises the need for more attention to flood   risk reduction and to working with low -income communities to design flood risk reduction   interventions that align closely with the priorities of local c ommunities .   \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT    This study sought  to establish  the experiences and challenges of the military personnel in   pursuing peace and conflict studie s by the Zambia A rmy. The  study,  was guided by  the   following objectives:  establish the number of military personnel pursuing Peace and Conf lict   Studies in Zambia Army;  determine the relevance of Peace and Conflict Studies to military   personnel; establish th e experiences of military personnel in pursuing Peace and  Conflict   Studies ; establish the challenges faced by military personnel in pursuing Peace and  Conflict   Studies  and suggest alternative strategies aimed at addressing challenges that military   personne l face in trying to pursue Peace and Conflict Studies.    A qualitative research approach using a descriptive phenomenological  research design was   used to conduct the study. The study targeted  militar y officers  from Military Training   Establishment of Zambia (MILTEZ) , Arakan, Mikango and Chindwin barracks. The   participants for the study sample were 40 and these included:  Commandant  Defence Services   Command  and Staff College  (DSCSC), the Chief of T raining, the Chief of O perations  and the    Commandant of the Peacekeeping Mission Training C entre  (PMTC),  by virtue of their   positions . On the other hand, convenience sa mpling was used to select the sample for  the   study . The study established that few military personnel were pursuing peace and conflict   studies in the Zam bia army. It was also established that peace and conflict studies helped the   military personnel to handle peace and security matters of the nation professionally, helped   the officers to manage and resolve national, regional and international conflicts and also help   the officers to remain current in knowledge and skills. On the experiences of the officers in   pursuing peace and conflict studies, it was established that the officers found it interesting   and easy to pursue such a programme despite the challenge s of securing study leave and   inadequate financial resources for undertaking of the programme .   Based on these findings, t he study concludes that peace and conflict studies are relevant to   the military personnel because the knowledge and skills acquired from these studies help   them to perform their duties professionally during management and conflict resolutions at   national, regional and international arenas.   In view of the above findings and the conclusion   drawn,  the researcher mad e the following recomm endations: The Government of  Republic of   Zambia  (GRZ ) through the  Ministry of Defence  (MOD ) to ensure that study leave is made   available to deserving  officers  so as to increase the chances of the military officers pursuing   peace and conflict studies ; the M .O.D to ensure that officers who are granted study leave to   pursue peace and conflict studies are elevated in rank upon completion so as to motivate  them    and also encourage others to under take similar  studies; the M.O.D to introduce education   loans at lowe r interest rate to officer s under taking a course of study in peace studies  to   facilitate payments of tuition fees by the of ficers under taking the studies and finally, t he   MOD  to ensure that the curriculum for the military personnel training is revised to  include   the component of peace and conflict studies at all levels of training so as to help each and   every military personnel acquire the knowledge and skills in peace and conflict management   and resolution.  \n",

            "              v    However, the findings also indicate that schools were not just siting idol. Schools were doing   something about this situation. The Parents‟ Teacher Association in collaboration with school   administration had st arted to build classroom blocks and also lobbying from Constituency   Development fund to help in building new classroom blocks.     The study concluded that the implementation of the vocational career pathway was being   implemented in very difficult circumstan ces. The old infrastructure being used was also bad and   inadequate. If the government did not intervene now education provision in the vocational career   pathway will not be up to date and learning will not be taking place. The state will have   graduates wit hout the skills, knowledge and a changed behaviour to fit in any society beyond   Zambia. Based on these findings the study recommends that the government should first allocate   some initial funding for infrastructure, equipment, teaching and learning resourc es and   specialists before upgrading a primary school into a secondary school.                                              \n",

            "v    which the syllabus was moved. I t was  establishe d that the policy was not useful to low ability   learners  as it promoted failing  especially to the  illiterate learners and it also  contributed  to   low standards of  education .    In this study  it was  recommended that the MoGE should  stop automatic grade seven   progression to grade eight and re -introduce a reasonable cut off point for grade seven   selection to grade eight to ensure that  learners with  at least with a certain level of a bility and   knowledge enter secondary  school . It was also recommended that in order to effectively    progress learners , the government should consider the ability, literacy and knowledge levels   of the learner.     The conclusion was  that automatic progression affected learner performance. Most   progressed learners were found to be illiterate in English which contributed to poor academic   performance. The policy contributed to the low learner morale and self -esteem. Most   automatic progr essed learners were found to be passive in class with less hope to progress to   senior secondary school due failure to get concepts. It also contributed to high enrolment in   the classes which hindered chance and time for teachers to give each individual lea rner   attention and use of variety of teaching methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

This   research review ed a number  of national and local reports on solid waste management in order   to understand the national and local state of the field. It also  used the direct interview technique   and questionn aire administration  to obtain data on the social and economic aspects of the   research. It is also important to understand that a waste management system should ideally   consist of environmentally acceptable waste management practices that are aimed at   minim izing waste generation from both domestic and industrial/commercial activities.      This study determined that in order for a solid waste management system to be effective, there   has to be collaboration between the community participation and government.  Local   government authorities are entrusted with the responsibility for the provision of solid waste   collection and disposal services.  It is the responsibility of the local government through the   respective councils to establish technical agencies that will  authorize contracting of private   enterprises and informal businesses (community based enterprises) to provide waste   management services. This study also concluded that  involving formal and informal sectors in   the management of waste will improve service d elivery and provide social and economic   empowerment for the residents and the various sectors involved.                     \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT    This study sought  to establish  the experiences and challenges of the military personnel in   pursuing peace and conflict studie s by the Zambia A rmy. The  study,  was guided by  the   following objectives:  establish the number of military personnel pursuing Peace and Conf lict   Studies in Zambia Army;  determine the relevance of Peace and Conflict Studies to military   personnel; establish th e experiences of military personnel in pursuing Peace and  Conflict   Studies ; establish the challenges faced by military personnel in pursuing Peace and  Conflict   Studies  and suggest alternative strategies aimed at addressing challenges that military   personne l face in trying to pursue Peace and Conflict Studies.    A qualitative research approach using a descriptive phenomenological  research design was   used to conduct the study. The study targeted  militar y officers  from Military Training   Establishment of Zambia (MILTEZ) , Arakan, Mikango and Chindwin barracks. The   participants for the study sample were 40 and these included:  Commandant  Defence Services   Command  and Staff College  (DSCSC), the Chief of T raining, the Chief of O perations  and the    Commandant of the Peacekeeping Mission Training C entre  (PMTC),  by virtue of their   positions . On the other hand, convenience sa mpling was used to select the sample for  the   study . The study established that few military personnel were pursuing peace and conflict   studies in the Zam bia army. It was also established that peace and conflict studies helped the   military personnel to handle peace and security matters of the nation professionally, helped   the officers to manage and resolve national, regional and international conflicts and also help   the officers to remain current in knowledge and skills. On the experiences of the officers in   pursuing peace and conflict studies, it was established that the officers found it interesting   and easy to pursue such a programme despite the challenge s of securing study leave and   inadequate financial resources for undertaking of the programme .   Based on these findings, t he study concludes that peace and conflict studies are relevant to   the military personnel because the knowledge and skills acquired from these studies help   them to perform their duties professionally during management and conflict resolutions at   national, regional and international arenas.   In view of the above findings and the conclusion   drawn,  the researcher mad e the following recomm endations: The Government of  Republic of   Zambia  (GRZ ) through the  Ministry of Defence  (MOD ) to ensure that study leave is made   available to deserving  officers  so as to increase the chances of the military officers pursuing   peace and conflict studies ; the M .O.D to ensure that officers who are granted study leave to   pursue peace and conflict studies are elevated in rank upon completion so as to motivate  them    and also encourage others to under take similar  studies; the M.O.D to introduce education   loans at lowe r interest rate to officer s under taking a course of study in peace studies  to   facilitate payments of tuition fees by the of ficers under taking the studies and finally, t he   MOD  to ensure that the curriculum for the military personnel training is revised to  include   the component of peace and conflict studies at all levels of training so as to help each and   every military personnel acquire the knowledge and skills in peace and conflict management   and resolution.  \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT       This study  examined  the ca uses of operational stress in  soldiers, ad verse effects, and assessed  the   role of counselling  in reducing operational s tress in soldiers in  Kabwe.  Zambia . Stress and   stressors are an inherent part of warfare because of the violence, the physical conditions, and   duration of operations. Stress represents “the mobilization ” of the body and mind to co unteract   stressors. The causes of stress will always be there as long as soldiers are deployed  in an   environment which is a br eeding ground, for example during operation s in battle front and   prolonged operation and other factors . Early identifica tion of st ressors and adverse effects can   minimize  the negative effects of c ombat and operational s tress (COS). Adverse refers to   physical, mental, and emotional manifestations; loss of personne l due to combat ineffectiveness .   The study therefore, was aimed at findi ng ways of reducing stress. With the following objectives:   to determine the causes; determine the adverse effect of operational stress and assess the role of   counselling in reducing operational stress in soldiers at Chindwin and Kohima barracks, the   study  revealed that counseling is one of the measures which can minimize the high le vels of   operational stress in  soldiers deployed and after, if incorporated in the training programmes by   utilizing the services of the professional chaplains and medical personne l.  A descriptive survey   was used in conducting the research. Collection of data was done by interviewing a sample   population of 50 participants and by use of questionnaires. Qualitative method was employed to   collect data. Qualitative research emphasizes understanding of verbal narratives. The method   was used because participants were met at once hence it saved  on time.  The participants asserted   that counseling can play a vital role through the services of military chaplain  counselors and   mental health pr ofessionals in Operational S tress cont rol for prevention, identification,   counseling therapy and treatment . Through questionnaires and interviews it was established that   those who were counseled received help than those who did not. In this case pro counse ling must   be extended even when the soldiers are out of stressful field in order to prevent unusual behavior   such as extremely d rug/alcohol abuse, in dulge in s exuality , malingering, absenteeism without   official leave, marital problems, financial indiscipli ne just to  mention a few.           \n",

The   purpose was to describe the best ways through which leaders can influence all members to   want to prevent fraud and corruption in an organization.  This was  a descriptive survey in   which 60 managers , currently employed in organizations  in Zambia and Lesotho, were   interviewed or administered with a survey form  to collect the data.  The content qu alitative   analysis methods and M icrosoft  excel pivot analysis too l was used for data analysis and   presentation.           The study found  that the levels of awareness on how leaders can encourage or lose control   of preventing fraud and corruption that yields a bad work culture among managers was   high.  It described, using viv id illustrative examples, the best practice of leaders in averting   fraud and corruption in line with the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership Model. It   drew out lessons learned from the past experience s of managers, amidst obstacles and   challenges , on how to restore a good work culture. Eight crucial steps that leaders new to   an organization should take to recreate a good work culture free from fraud were  presented.          It was recommended that managers should : - Encourag e and support training of all   employ ees in fraud and corruption risk management to get all  on the same page; identify   the indicators that show signs of a good work culture and that fraud / corruption is taking   place, monitor and control it; exercise  the five practices of exemplary leadership in getting   people to commit to preventing internal fraud; and develop psychological hardness in   curbing widespread fraud and corruption. Further research is to investigate types of best   practices  that apply at each level of managemen t and the extent to whi ch it yield s impact   at organization al level .   \n",

            "v | P a g e     issues that came out were having overcrowded clas srooms, overworked teachers and in adequate   text books. What also came out were  the poverty levels which in some cases led to not having   three meals in a day. Motivation for teachers was also cardinal in producing good results.   Equating this situation to K alumbila district this is true. The North Western Province strategic   plan also talks about the need for strengthening the efficiency and effectiveness of the education   management system in the province.       Having carried out the study the following were my  findings it was discovered that most   schools were operating without setting goals as to where they were and what they intended to be   in future. Administrator interviewed also talked about having fewer teacher hence not being very   effective in managing the ir schools,  working with teams , multi tasking and managing groups   while  overseeing their school operations proved very difficult to most of the administrators   talked to. On the second objective little was being done to interpret the results which the sch ool   had. Only 5 schools indicated that they were having teacher group meetings. This was not a   healthy sign.    The following are my recommendations: firstly all administrators should be trained in   educational management. Secondly administrators should not b e left to act for a very long time it   de motivates them. The reading records kept by the school should always be used to make future   decisions.                                   \n",

God is at home, it's we who have gone out for a walk.    The price of inaction is far greater than the cost of making a mistake.    Over and above, I thank God for the sufficient grace and strength throughout this PhD   Journey. Indeed as in HIS WORD: \"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made   perfect in weakness.\" 2 Corinthians 12:9 & “For I know the plan s I have for you,” declares   the Lord, “plans to prosper  you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”     Jeremiah 29:11.    I pray the “thank you”  prayer every day of my life for the abundant blessings that I have   received. Yet, it somehow does  not seem to be enough to only say \"thank you\" to those I am   about to recognise.    I am greatly indebted to my sole supervisor Dr Daniel Ndhlovu for providing me with   guidance, encouragement, wisdom and constructive criticism throughout this academic   journey .  My supervisor was indeed my mentor as he made me realise that though the   undertaking seemed impossible it was feasible.  I stumbled many times along the pathway,   and yet he made me realise that I needed to pick up the pieces and journey on. As I travell ed   with this scholar, my mentor, I began to realise that actually it was more about the learning   process than the destination. I thank you for allowing me to stagger, for providing important   tips at the right time and for not giving up on me. You made me h ave confidence in that the \n",

The purpose of the study was to establish the facto rs leading to low levels of participation in   Adult literacy programmes among men in Namwala Dist rict.   The study had two main objectives with the overall objective being to identify factors which   lead to low levels of participation in adult litera cy programmes among men in Namwala   District. The specific objectives were: to establis h why men enrolled into adult literacy   programmes; and to identify factors that inhibit me n from participating in adult literacy   programmes.   The study employed  a case study design. Semi-struc tured questionnaires and interview   guides were used to collect quantitative and qualit ative data. The sample size was 200   respondents as follows: 1 District Commissioner; 7 government departmental heads; 12   facilitators; 5 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) comp rising 6 men in each FGD, bringing the   total number of participants in the FGDs to 30; 50 non-participants and 100 participants.   The study established that both basic and functiona l literacy were being offered and that men   engaged in the programmes so that they could, among  other things, be able to read and write   and also improve their farming and livestock manage ment skills. It was further revealed that   some men chose not to take part in the adult litera cy programmes because they felt shy, felt   they were too old for any learning and that the pro grammes were a waste of time. The study   recommended that the government constructs infrastr ucture specifically for adult literacy   programmes and also that the providers of adult lit eracy programmes embark on sensitisation   activities of adult literacy programmes.                   \n",

            "6    HIV and AIDS figures for the general population. CS O had data on HIV and AIDS for the   general population but why it did not have specific  data for persons with disabilities is a matter   of concern. CSO is a national department that condu cts research and provides vital statistical   information on vital issues affecting the country s uch as poverty, housing, disease etc. It is   equally their responsibility to have data on disabi lities. The lack of statistics is a sign that the   disabled are marginalized and sidelined in research  studies and indeed their welfare. The hearing   impaired learners in particular are more disadvanta ged. The nature of disability they have makes   them find difficulties accessing HIV and AIDS educa tion. No studies in Zambia have been   undertaken to find out how many hearing impaired pe ople are HIV and AIDS positive and how   many have died from the scourge. However, learning from other countries like the United States   of America, The American Social Health Association (2001) estimates showed that between 8   000 and 40 000 deaf and hard of hearing were living  with HIV in the United States. This takes   into consideration care for the disadvantaged. Thou gh this was a positive development, the   American Social Health Association (2001) further o bserved that studies on HIV and AIDS   among the hearing impaired were limited and said be cause studies on the deaf and hard of   hearing were limited; it was unclear exactly how ma ny people within this sub-population were   living with HIV/AIDS. It was discovered that there was a continued communication gap in   delivering culturally competent care to the deaf an d hard of hearing and this problem perpetuated   misunderstandings about health risks and preventive  practices.  Further, in the United States of   America, the prevalence rate of HIV and AIDS among the deaf and hard of hearing is greater   than among the general population. As early as 1992 , experts estimated that the American deaf   population was behind by eight years in HIV knowled ge and awareness. This is according to the   US Health Resources and Services Administration (20 01). This is a lesson we should learn from   that investment in information dissemination about HIV and AIDS among the hearing impaired   people is dearly needed, lest the hearing impaired face extinction.   The right to information is universal but if inform ation is denied, the right is meaningless. The   deaf population equally has the right to protection  against diseases. Kelly (2008:61) notes that   “HIV/AIDS may be impairing the right of every child  to an education of good quality, regardless   of the health status of the family or the child”.

            "v    ABSTRACT       This study  examined  the ca uses of operational stress in  soldiers, ad verse effects, and assessed  the   role of counselling  in reducing operational s tress in soldiers in  Kabwe.  Zambia . Stress and   stressors are an inherent part of warfare because of the violence, the physical conditions, and   duration of operations. Stress represents “the mobilization ” of the body and mind to co unteract   stressors. The causes of stress will always be there as long as soldiers are deployed  in an   environment which is a br eeding ground, for example during operation s in battle front and   prolonged operation and other factors . Early identifica tion of st ressors and adverse effects can   minimize  the negative effects of c ombat and operational s tress (COS). Adverse refers to   physical, mental, and emotional manifestations; loss of personne l due to combat ineffectiveness .   The study therefore, was aimed at findi ng ways of reducing stress. With the following objectives:   to determine the causes; determine the adverse effect of operational stress and assess the role of   counselling in reducing operational stress in soldiers at Chindwin and Kohima barracks, the   study  revealed that counseling is one of the measures which can minimize the high le vels of   operational stress in  soldiers deployed and after, if incorporated in the training programmes by   utilizing the services of the professional chaplains and medical personne l.  A descriptive survey   was used in conducting the research. Collection of data was done by interviewing a sample   population of 50 participants and by use of questionnaires. Qualitative method was employed to   collect data. Qualitative research emphasizes understanding of verbal narratives. The method   was used because participants were met at once hence it saved  on time.  The participants asserted   that counseling can play a vital role through the services of military chaplain  counselors and   mental health pr ofessionals in Operational S tress cont rol for prevention, identification,   counseling therapy and treatment . Through questionnaires and interviews it was established that   those who were counseled received help than those who did not. In this case pro counse ling must   be extended even when the soldiers are out of stressful field in order to prevent unusual behavior   such as extremely d rug/alcohol abuse, in dulge in s exuality , malingering, absenteeism without   official leave, marital problems, financial indiscipli ne just to  mention a few.           \n",

This was a hospital -based cross -sectional study carried out from 18th December,   2018 to 16th April, 2019 at the adult medical diabetic clinic. Snellen visual acuity    (VA) , blood pressure, weight and height were measured as well as relevant   demographic and medical information collected. Retinal images were captured after   pupil dilatation and used for grading  retinopathy using the International  classi fication   of DR  scale.  The worse eye was used to grade for DR.    A total of 213 participants were studied with a female to male ratio of 2.3:1.  The   median age was 53 years and majority  (183=85.2%) had type 2 diabetes. Median   duration of diabetes was five years with insulin therapy being the most common   (115= 54.5%) diabetes control measure. Anti-hypertensive medication  was being   used by 87 participants ( 40.9%). Median glycated haemoglobin l evel was high at   8.1%. One hundred sixty -three participants  (76.5 %) had normal VA and six (2.8%)   were blind.    The prevalence of DR in this study was 47.4%; 95% CI 40.8% -54.2% (101   participants), with 8.9% (19 participants)  having proliferative diabetic reti nopathy.    Diabetic macula oedema  was present in 24 (11.3%; 95% CI 7.5% -16.1%). Duration   of diabetes was the most significant  (p<0.0001)  association found with retinopathy;   as well as alcohol intake and having diabetic foot (another microvascular   complicati on).

            "v       Climate scenarios were generated using LARS -WG and AgMIP protocols . The   suitability of LARS -WG in generating current and future climate scenarios was   evaluated using CMIP3 HadCM3 and BCM2 global climate models (GCMs) for B1   and A1B scenarios. The current (1980 -2010) and future (2040 -2070) climate scenarios   used as inputs into the CSM s were generated using 5 GCMs (E, I, K, O, R)  and RCPs    (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 ) scenarios using the AgMIP protocols. APSIM -Maize and   CERES -Maize models were used to evaluate maize yield to response to PD, N, cultivar    and climate scenarios  assuming constant m anagement. Future changes in phenology    and yield were estimated as the difference between future and baseline period.       Extreme precipitation (PRCPTOT, R30 mm, RX5day, R95pTOT) indices were   statistically non -significant. Mount Makulu warming are due to incr ease in mean and   maximum temperature . LARS -WG projected an increase in temperature (Observed   station data [1.50oC (B1: 2050), 1.84oC (A1B: 2050)], AgMERRA data [1.48oC (B1:   2050), 1.84oC (A1B: 2050)]) and variability in precipitation.  The projected ensemble   mean annual temperature using the AgMIP protocols is expected to increase by 1.82°C   (RCP4.5) and 2.48oC (RCP8.5). However, rainfall is projected to decrease by 1.46%   (RCP4.5) and 1.91% (RCP8.5). APSIM -Maize and CERES -Maize models simulated   fewer  DAP to anthesis and maturity  relative to the baseline . Maize grain yield (-6.90 -   +4.06 (RCP4.5), -10.80 - +5.00% (RCP8.5) [APSIM -Maize]; -0.59 to +25.77%   (RCP4.5) and -6.52 to +20.21% (RCP8.5) [CERES -Maize] ) would decrease or   increase relative to the basel ine. PD, N, and rainfall  would affect future grain yield .      The simulated versus observed values of DAP to anthesis, and maturity, grain yield,   grain size, and grain number m-2 and soil water content had normalized root mean   square error < 20% and d -stat > 0.71. The models can be used to predict phenology   and yield . Using an ensemble mean of the CSMs, DAP to anthesis ( -11.28 to -9.39%   [RCP4.5]; -14.28 to -12.65% [RCP8.5]) and maturity ( -10.52 to -9.43% [RCP4.5]; -  14.01 to -12.75% [RCP8.5]) would reduce in 2 050. The % change in grain would range   from 2.78 to 9.94%, -3.81 to -8.88% and -2.33 to 10.63% under N1, N , and N3,   respectively. Grain yield would increase/or decrease with delay in PD (RCP4.5 [PD1   = 2.57%; PD2=3.31%; PD3=4.37%]; RCP8.5 [PD1 = -1.11%; PD2 =-0.29%;   PD3=1.08%]). The current PDs and cultivars with lower N (N1) would increase grain   yield in  future. However, grain yield would increase with higher N (N3) at PD3.       To establish credibility in CSM s for use at  a local scale, they have to be adequately   calibrated and validated. The calibration and validation of APSIM -Maize and CERES -  Maize models were necessary for their application to new cultivars to minimize   uncertainty. C SMs can be used to simulate probable outc omes in crop management   strategies, N fertilizer rate, PD and impact of climate change on crop growth and yield.   Earlier PDs with lower N would lead to an increase in grain yield than at higher N.   Proposed i mprovements in the CSM s are phenological stage du ration and LAI   prediction under subtropical environment s. The mitigation and adaptation strategies   for CC includes changing PDs, N management, cultivar selection, water managemen t,   and tillage practices.  Future model evaluations may be needed for new cultivars.

Thus, t his research work wa s a case study aimed at investigating gender gaps   in school administrative positions  in Chilanga  district. Its main objective were  to assess the   gender gaps in school administrative positions with regards to rural and urban schools in   Chilanga district.     The literature reviewed showed the prevalence of gender gap s in education and their   consequence on economic growth. The literature reviewed supports two obvious policy   recommendations: increasing women‟s access to education and promote their  participation in   decision making  positions , this includes administrative p ositions in education sector.    Qualitative methods were used to collect and analyze data from 70 participants who were   selected purposively and randomly . This included, the district education board secretary, 2   Senior Education Standard Off icers ( ESO) , 2 top management officials from HR department, 20   school administrators, 5 PTA chairpersons , and  40 Teachers (20 males and 20 females)   respectively . Data from one to one  semi -structured interviews  and questionnaire s were   thematically analysed. Presentatio ns of the findings were done using tables , direct quotations and    simple narrations.    However, t he findings of the study revealed  that the  current situation of gender gaps  in   administrative  positions in both rural and urban schools was as a result of  male  domina nce in   administrative positions and qualities  for school administrators. Motivation was found to be a   leading factor in the current changes in gender gaps in school administrative positions. Gender \n",

            "      iv    ABSTRACT    The purpose of the s tudy was to evaluate the performance of the revised curriculum on the   provision of quality education in the selected public primary schools in Kazungula District of   Southern Province, Zambia. This research study had three objectives. The first one was to a ssess   how well the revised curriculum was performing in the provision of quality education. The second   objective was to identify the relationship between the revised curriculum and provision of quality   education and the third was to evaluate the revised cu rriculum impact on the provision of quality   education.    A descriptive research design was used in this study and data was analyzed using both quantitative   and qualitative approaches. In this study, the sixty - seven (67) sample size for this study comprised    02 ESOs from the District Education Board Office, 05)head teachers, 05 Deputy Head teachers,   10 senior teachers and 45 teachers from 05 government primary schools in Kazungula district. 45   Teachers were sampled using stratified random sampling. Simple ran dom sampling was used to   select 6 pupils and 20 teachers while purposeful sampling was used to select 4 school   administrators.    The major findings of the study were lack of quantity and quality of teaching staff to meet the   expectations of the pupils and th e society, and poor condition of service for curriculum   implementation. There was also shortage of teaching learning materials, 57.9% indicated that the   revised curriculum had impact on the provision of quality education in primary schools; it has   helped l earners to obtain computer literacy at an early age, it has compelled some teachers to   acquire computer literacy in order to cope with the new curriculum requirements.    Based on the findings of the study, four recommendations were given. There was need to c ontinue   the construction of more primary schools especially in rural areas and this could be accompanied   by the construction of more classrooms so as to address the problem of teacher pupil ratio. There   was need to provide quality teaching and learning mat erials. These could be enough so as to   address the problem of book pupil ratio. More teachers could also be trained in handling   technological subjects. There is also need to reorient teachers on how to deliver the content of the   revised curriculum in the c lassroom.     \n",

            "iv    ABSTRACT       In Zambia, many smallholder farmers achieve household food security through the production of   maize ‘zea  mays’.  During the years of maize failure due to drought, there is need for other crops to   enhance food security like Orange Fleshed Sweet Potato. Since the 2010/2011 farming season, the   Orange Fleshed Sweet Potato has been integrated in the farming syste m of the smallholder farmers   of Eastern Province to help the household food security.    The aim of this study was on the diffusion of the Orange Fleshed Sweet Potato and its contribution   to the household food security and livelihoods of the smallholder farme rs in Petauke District of   Eastern Province in Zambia. The specific objectives were: i, To establish the diffusion of the   OFSP;ii, To assess the contributions of the OFSP to household food security in ; iii, To find out the   livelihoods improvement for smallh older farmer households and iv, To identify the challenges   smallholder farmers face in the growing of the OFSP . A questionnaire was used to collect data from   a purposively selected sample of 118Orange Fleshed Smallholder farmers. Key informants and two   Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were used to triangulate data from the questionnaire. The analysis   of quantitative data was done by the aid of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 20).   This helped to come up with percentages presented in statistic al tables and graphs.    The innovation was introduced in Petauke in 2010/2011 farming season by the International Potato   Centre. In 2011/2012; 76.3% smallholder farmers adopted the crop while in 2012/2013; 6.7%   additional smallholder farmers adopted and in the 2013/2014; 16.9% respondents adopted.  The   diffusion of the Orange Fleshed Sweet Potatoes was through hierarchical diffusion which was   expansion in nature. The pillars of food security met were food availability and access.    The crop contributed to the household food security because the adopters had additional food from   the OFSP. The livelihoods of the people improved because they were able to raise money to by   household goods and managed to buy family goods and services. The challenges the farmers face d   were the acquisition of vines for planting, diseases, pests and difficulties in preservation. The other   challenge was lack or insufficient different types of capitals like physical, financial, and social. A   lot of opportunities exist for the OFSP because  the crop was viable as it contributed to their   livelihood that they could buy farming implements and inputs for other crops like maize from the   money earned after selling the harvest.       Key words : innovation, diffusion, food security, orange fleshed sweet potatoes , livelihood, capital                       \n",

            "      v    ABSTRACT    Conservation Agriculture (CA) has widely been promoted by government through t he   Conservation Farming Unit of the Zambia National Farmers Union and non-governmental   organizations such as Land Mana gement and Conservation Farming Project, the Golden   Valley A gricultural Research Trust , the Institute of Agricultural and Environmental   Engineering Project, the Cooperative League of the USA, World Vision and various donors to   address problems of low crop yields and food insecurity among smallholder farmers in   Zamb ia. Despite the increasing interest and funding in CA, its disadoption among smallholder   farmers is common especially after the end of CA projects. Several studies have been   undertaken on the adoption of CA but few studies have been conducted on the factor s that   lead to disadoption of CA. Thus, this study identifies factors that contribute to disadoption of   CA and opportunities for reducing disadoption among smallholder farmers in Petauke District   of Zambia.       The data was collected from 92 randomly selecte d smallholder farming households using   questionnaires; in -depth interviews with seven purposively selected key informants and four   focus group discussions. Qualitative data was analyzed by thematic and content analysis and   quantitative data was analyzed by  chi-square and a binary regression. Results show that 29   percent of smallholder farmers disadopted CA. CA basins were the most disadopted due to   their labour intensiveness. The four most commonly cited factors leading to disadoption of   CA as reported by smallholder farmers are lack of farm transport for manure (31 percent),   high labour demand (25 percent), lack of adequate knowledge in CA (16 percent), a nd lack of   free incentives (16 percent). Chi -square analysis showed significant association between each   of the following factors with disadoption of CA: labour intensity; lack of access to free   incentives; lack of farm transport for manure and poor local CA leadership. Regression results   showed that lack of transport for manure; lack of adequate knowledge in CA; location and   lack of free incentives (material items given) contributed significantly towards increased   likelihood of CA disadoption at 0.05 level  of significance. From the smallholder farmers‟   perception s, options for reducing the disadoption of CA were increased access to free   incentives including herbicides; enhance CA training; increase access to transportation of   manure; provision of CA equipme nt and good local CA leadership.       Thus this study concludes that most of the factors that influence disadoption involve the   attitude  of the farmers, dependency on incentives, labour constraints, poor rapport between the   local CA leadership and smallholder farmers, and lack of essential CA assets. This study   recommends that CA promoters, donors and government should help smallholder farmers to   become self -reliant, reduce their provision of free agricultural inputs and enhance CA   trainings to smallholder farm ers so as to minimize disadoption of the technology. Introduction   of CA in communities should be based on scientific evidence rather than material incentives.                 \n",

            "   iii    ABSTRACT       This research examines the policy and legislat ive framework  on investment expropriation in   Zambia, against international law i nstruments. It outlines the investment policy and law on   investment expropriation at the international, regional and national levels. Finally, this   research identifies the gaps in the expropriation policy and legisl ation in Zambia in relation to   international investment l aw instruments and assesses whether the policy and law benefit   both the Zambian citizen s and investors. The main question investigated in this research was   whether the investment  expropriation  policy and l aw in Zambia contains any gaps, and to   determine the extent to which these gaps could be sealed in order for the policy and law to   have tangible benefits to the Zambians. The research employed a social legal  approach to   analyse the policy and legislative f ramework on investment expropriation in Zambia. The   methods of d ata collection w ere triangulated between secondary and primary data  collection   methods , as a way of broadening the scope of investigation. Secondary data collection   included consultations of a  wide range of documents. Sources of data included United   Nations General Assembl y Resolutions and Instruments, A rticles from journals, books,   internet materials and so on. Primary data included administration of an interview guides to a   cross section of R espondents. The Respondents were purposively selected based on their   expertise. Interviews were both formal and guided by interview guides. Formal interviews   were tape recorded and later transcribed and analysed, using thematic analysis techniques.   The mai n findings of this research are as follows:  (a) the Zambian policy on  investment    expropriation is not in line with international i nvestment expropriation policy. On the other   hand, the legislative framework reviewed is in line with international investment    expropriation law save for the Mines and Minerals Development which has no provision on   investment expropriation ; (b) s econdly, the policy on investment expropriation as contained   in the 7NDP, RSNDP  and MRD  Policy  are too broad and addresses investment in general,   thereby creating gaps; and  (c) thirdly, the law as contained in the Zambia Development   Agency, Mining and, Land acquisition are not comprehensive enough to achieve the   objectives set under international law, thus creating gaps between internationa l law   expectations and national law and further that it does not differentiate between the two   opposing concepts of expropriation and regulation. The  research notes that investment policy   and legislation in Zambia on expropriation is inadequate though some  of the key policy   considerations and principles of international investment law appears to have been   domesticated to a certain extent. The research recommends that there is need for government   to come up with a comprehensive investment policy and law on e xpropriation that takes into   account Zambian history and capacity as a nation, as well as differentiating between the two   opposing concepts of expropriation and regulation.

            "\t\t\t  \tvi\tABSTRACT Company registers are increasingly becoming a crucial source of business information for many stakeholders. While most company registers have concentrated on simplifying business registrations, reducing the number of procedures, time and cost for small entities to be formed, compliance remains a big challenge for many Company Registers. Compliance is not just influenced by economic variables of enforcement and penalties but should be understood in the context of behaviour as influenced by demographic, socio-economic and Institutional factors. The aim of this study was to identify and explain the factors influencing compliance behaviour in filing company annual returns based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour in Zambia. The study used a mixed research approach. A sample of 165 registered companies was randomly selected from the population of 68,049 active companies on the PACRA register. Nine PACRA officers were selected using judgment sampling and in-depth interviews were used.  Primary data were collected through structured questionnaires. The secondary data were also collected by reviewing related published and unpublished materials.  Statistical tests of independence (chi-square tests) formed the basis of analysis.  The results of this study showed that annual return filings are influenced both by demographic and external factors. The demographic factors like employment status, Age and education were found to positively influence compliance. Further, compliance was highest (68%) among those with tertiary education compared with (47%) among those with no form of schooling. The study also revealed that those in formal employment were more compliant (64%) than those without employment (47%).  Gender was found to be an insignificant factor and such it has no influence on compliance. On external factors, cultural norms, government policies and compliance fees were identified in the study and were found to have an influence on compliance (save for compliance fees). Finally, the findings of the study may guide government institutions that spend huge costs on enforcement year in year out but it is not so effective and that low penalty fees do not all the time cause voluntary compliance. Further, before Institutions implement costly sensitization campaigns and educational clinics, they need to understand variables that cause compliance behaviour. The study findings can help Policy makers and PACRA meeting its strategic goals of raising compliance levels which currently stand at 40% to about 70%.

            "v    ABSTRACT          HIV/AIDS remains a major challenge particularly among women of child bearing   age. Globally, there are about 36.6 million people living with HIV infection and   about 70 % (25 million) of these live in sub -Saharan Africa .  HIV burden needs   greater attention  in the planning of EMTCT programmes. This study aimed at   determining the possible risks and the prevalence of HIV seroconversion in pregnant   women of Southern province in Zambia from 2012 to 2016. Also to assess adherence   to the recommended number of HIV tests. It was imperative to undertake this study   as the results would provide important insights to policy makers and for other   important decisions in an effort to reduce HIV seroconversion in pregnant women.    This was a retrospective cohort study design. Data was obtained from the Smart Care   data base in the department of Information Technology at Ministry of Health   Headquarters in Lusaka.  Cross tabulations were used to determine associations and   logistic regression analysis was used to determine the best  predictors at p -value less   than 0.05 and 95% confidence interval. Chi square for trends was used to assess the   trend of HIV seroconversion prevalence.   Complete case analysis was used to take   care of missing data.   Data was missing completely at random an d the missing values   were d istributed across all variables thus this was the suitable method.    From the study population (n=3,489), 242 seroconverted, giving an overall   prevalence of 6.9%.   The p -value (0.035) for trend analysis was statistically   significan t. There was no evidence of association for  marital status and partner HIV   test. Those with primary education had 91% reduced risk (p -value 0.02, CI 0.01 -  0.68) and those with secondary education had 85% reduced risk of seroconverting (p -  value 0.05, CI 0.02 -1.01). These were statistically significant at multivariable   analysis.   148 (6.3%) of those married seroconverted . Majority (86.2%) of the study   participants had two HIV tests.  The trend for HIV seroconversion in pregnant women   of Southern province was do wnwards from 2015 to 2016.   Primary and secondary   education levels were independently significant factors associated with HIV   seroconversion.  Adherence to the recommended number of HIV tests was poor as   majority of participants only had two tests .   Key ter ms: HIV Seroconversion, Elimination of Mother to Child Transmission   (EMTCT), Antenatal Care (ANC), Smart Care data . \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT    Accurate determination of weight is essential to avoid drug errors. Where weighing is not   feasible, age or length based formulae are used  to estimate weight. Formulae must be   validated in the local population as most are derived from high income countries where   childhood obesity is increasing.    The “Lusaka formula” was derived from a previously published data set. The study aimed to   validate  this formula in a new data set. Weights, heights and age of 330 children were   measured before surgery. Accuracy was examined by comparing the (1) Mean Percentage   Error and (2) the percentage of actual weights that fell between 10% and 20% of the   estimated  weight for the Lusaka formula and other existing formulae.    The Lusaka formula had a mean percentage error of 1.37% (95% limits of agreement 7.7, -  6.8) and estimated weights to within 10% of actual weight 48.5% of the time. It had a slight   tendency to under estimate weights. Its precision was comparable to the Broselow tape.    No significant difference was found between the sexes with regards to the mean age,   measured weight and estimated weights differences but  regression analysis showed that   maternal educatio n level significantly predicts weight for children above 1 year. Out of the   163 children aged 0 -5 years, 17.8% had under nutrition of varying extents; 3.1% had extreme   malnutrition, 3.1% had severe malnutrition and 11.7% had moderate malnutrition.    The stud y concluded that when actual weight is unknown, the Lusaka formula is superior to   previously published age based weight estimating formulae in children presenting for surgery   at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) in Lusaka, Zambia. Newer formulae signi ficantly   overestimated weights of the children in this population.    Keyword s: Paediatric, weight estimation, low middle -income countries.                    \n",

            "vi    ABSTRACT       Mining is an important economic activity in many developed and developing countries and has   the potential to  shape and affect economies directly and indirectly. Zambia is regarded as a   mining country because of the contribution of mining to its exports, domestic markets,   employment, and opportunities for economic growth and diversification.  Zambia produces 5   percent of the world‟s copper production and it has been generally increasing since 2000. The   increased production has led to quick depletion of ore reserves. The depletion of copper ore   reserves would seriously threaten economic growth and stability. The cop per resources available   to existing mines in Zambia are estimated at 2.8 billion tonnes of ore ranging between 0.6 and   4.0 percent copper. In addition, Zambia has potentially recoverable ores estimated at 1.6 billion   tonnes ranging between 0.4 and 0.5% cop per. In Zambia, economically recoverable copper   deposits are those with grades more than 0.5% for surface mining and more than 1.5 percent for   underground mining. In countries like Chile, Australia, and Canada, deposits at 0.4 percent and   1.0 percent are e conomically extracted by surface and underground mining respectively. Because   copper mining industry is an important economic activity for Zambia,  there is need to   investigate possibilities of economically mining marginal copper ore reserves. The purpose of   this research is therefore to investigate, analyse and determine Zambia‟s potential for mining low   grade copper deposits. If economically mineable, the low -grade deposits will increase copper   reserves from 2.8 billion to 4.4 billion tonnes. The addition al resources would prolong mining   for approximately 30 years.       In order to determine techno -economic potential for mining Zambia‟s low grade copper deposits,   the study had to review the existing data on low grade deposit through literature survey. The   mine ral resources classification and codes of reporting systems were evaluated and it was   revealed that Zambia has not developed a code for the reporting of exploration results, mineral   resources and mineral reserves. It is therefore recommended to employ modi fied United Nations   Framework Classification (UNFC) to develop a Zambia‟s code. The study also analysed macro -  environmental factors affecting Zambia‟s potential for mining low grade copper ore deposits.   PESTLE and SWOT analysis were used to evaluate the ex ternal and internal macro   environmental factors. A more accurate multi -criteria decision making model for PESTLE   analysis was developed and applied. The results indicate that the level of the macro environment   is moderately favorable to mining of low grade  copper ore deposits at the current situation. If   Zambia has to attract credible investors in the mining sector, the country has to improve its   macro -environment level. This can be achieved by addressing the country‟s weaknesses   identified in the SWOT anal ysis.       Kakosa South low grade copper ore deposit was selected as a case study. Kakosa is located about   450km northwest of Lusaka, the capital city of Zambia. In Kakosa area, the footwall aquifer   rocks comprising sandstone and conglomerates are thin and as  such are not expected to represent \n",

            "5    ABSTRACT    Epilepsy is a disorder caused by many factors, including infection of the central nervous system   with the larval stage of Taenia solium, leading to neurocysticercosis (NCC). People with   epilepsy (PWE) in  low-income countries often do not receive appropriate treatment, which   besides the continuing epileptic seizures, may also lead to cognitive impairment, reduced quality   of life, stigma, injuries, and possibly death. The objective of this study was to desc ribe gaps in   epilepsy management in a T. solium endemic rural area of Zambia .    A cross -sectional study was conducted in Sinda district of the Eastern Province of Zambia   between August and October 2018. PWE identified from clinic records including PWE from a   previous study were re -contacted. PWE not recorded in the clinic records, but with a reported   history of epileptic seizures by community members were also included. Serum and stool   samples of PWE were collected and tested for cysticercosis and taeniosis  respectively. Two   questionnaires were administered, one to PWE and one to local healthcare providers  to describe   management for epilepsy, the reasons for non -treatment as well as, non -adherence to treatment,   and the associated risk factors.    A total of 146 PWE and 43 healthcare providers  were interviewed. Sixteen of the PWE were   diagnosed with definite NCC in a previous study . Samples were tested for 129 PWE out of the   130 who had never been diagnosed with NCC, and thereof 36  were diagnosed wi th probable   NCC following the Del Brutto diagnostic criteria . Forty -four percent of PWE were on anti -  epileptic drugs, however, only 26 (17.8%) were on regular anti -epileptic treatment, resulting in a   treatment gap of more than 82%. O ver 50% of healthcare providers  did not know the relationship   between epilepsy and NCC. The risk factors associated with lack of correct treatment were   stock -outs of anti -epileptic drugs, long distance to health facilities, lack of diagnostic equipment   and poor patient follow up , and PWE opting for traditional medicine .   The results of this study demonstrated that gaps in the management of epilepsy in PWE and NCC   are substantial  in Sinda district.  The causes are multifactorial, involving shortcomings on the   level of the health fac ilities, communities, and individuals. Significant improvements in the   supply and dispensing of anti -epileptic drugs, accompanied by closer monitoring and follow -ups   of PWE may be key in substantially reducing the management gap and subsequently address th e   challenges and suffering of PWE.  \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT    Social studies is aimed and intended at developing good and ideal citizens, who have an   understanding of the society they live in. It has also  been identified as a subject within the   school curriculum that is used as a vehicle for equipping learners with the requisite   knowledge, skills, values, attitudes and dispositions relevant for producing functional and   effective citizens. The purp ose of this study was to investigate  the challenges faced in   teaching and learning of Social Studies in selected primary schools in Lusaka District of   Zambia. The objectives of the study were; to explore the challenges faced in the teaching   and learning of Social Studies, to establish the method s used in the teaching and learning of   Social Studies, to ascertain the benefits of teaching and learning of Social Studies in primary   schools and to suggest solutions to the challenges faced in the teaching and learning of   social studies in primary school s. This study used a descriptive  research design which   employed a  qualitative strategy in order to effectively address the issues raised by the   research questions. The target  population was the CDC Social S tudies Specialists, Head   Teachers, Teachers and Le arners. The total sample size was 39 which comprised of 3 CDC   Social Studies specialists, 3 Head Teachers, 12 Teachers and 21 Learners. Purposive   sampling technique; in particular, homogenous sampling was used to select respondents .   The data collection ins truments used were semi structured interview guide, observation   checklist and document analysis whose findings were analyzed thematically.  The findings   revealed that there were enormous challenges faced in the teaching and learning of social   studies includ ing; multi discipline and diverse in nature , limited training, shortage of highly   skilled human resource, ra dical transformation in the  field, increasing social inequalities,   diversification of the economy, teacher qualification, teachers  using wrong teac hing   methods, access and quality, cultural differences, wastage and stagnation, absenteeism, poor   teacher to pupil ratio, teachers  not  being involved in curriculum development, negative   attitude by both the teachers and the learners, teachers not underst and the aims, purpose and   goals of social studies, less time allocation on the timetable  and learners not having access   to educational  tours. Social S tudies also do not receive vigorous support as a vital part of the   school curriculum and that schools lac ked teaching and learning materials.  Although, there   were recommended methods for teaching and learning social studies, teachers still used   wrong methods and did not democratize these methods during lesson presentation. However,   if taught well, social stud ies have a lot of benefits to the learners. It was therefore   recommended that both teachers and learners are sensitized, motivated and supported on the   importance of Social Studies. Teachers as implementers should be involved in the process of   curriculum d evelopment. Educational tours and site visits should be made a must for   particular topics. Primary schools should be provided with adequate materials   (infrastructure, text books etc.) to ease some of the challenges they face in teaching and   learning of soc ial studies.       Key words:  Challenges, Teaching, Learning, Primary Schools, Social Studies        \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT     Perforated Peptic ulcers (PPU) is one of the common finding in patients undergoing emergency   laparotomy for peritonitis at UTH, Adult Hospital, department of surgery, representing about   26.45% of these cases in a calendar year. A high risk of mortality and morbidity is encountered in   patients treated with surgery for PPU. Patient stratification and appropriate management according   to pat ients risk of mortality, has been recommended as a way of trying to improve outcomes in   patients with PPU. The aim of the study was to investigate the factors associated with mortality in   patients that present with PPU managed surgically at UTH. This was a  prospective cohort study,   conducted at UTH -Adult Hospital, Department of surgery targeting patients with PPU that had   undergone emergency laparotomy.  They were enrolled using interview administered   questionnaire and followed up for 30 -days post -operation . The primary outcome was 30 day post -  operation mortality. The study enrolled 38 participants of which 35 participants met the inclusion   criteria, 88.57% (n=31) male and 11.43% (n=4) female. The age ranged from 14 years to 84 years   with the mode age ranges  20 years – 30 years and 40 years – 50 years. Most patients presented   with two (2) or more complaints. Abdominal pain was common presenting complaint in all the   patients and other complaints included, nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension and   constipat ion. 82.86% (n=29) of the participants presented after 24 hours of onset of symptoms,   17.14% (n=6) were HIV positive and 42.86% (n=15) were in shock on presentation. More than   half of the participants were assessed as ASA score III or greater. On admission  40.00 % (n=14)   had elevated serum creatinine and 37.1 % (n=13) had low serum albumin. 91.43% (n=32) of PPU   were gastric perforations and 8.57 % (n=3) duodenal perforations and the mode and median range   of size of perforation was 5mm – 10mm. Length of hosp ital stay ranged from one(1) day to 13   days with a mean of 7.29 days. 30 -day post -operation mortality was 34.29% and 40% of the   participants developed a post operation complication. Univariate binary regression analysis found   Age, ASA score, Serum creatini ne, and Size of perforation to be significantly associated with   mortality (p -value <0.05, C.I. 95%). Univariate linear regression analysis found HIV positive   Status, and CD4 cell count level to be significantly associated with mortality(p -value <0.05; 95%   C.I.). Multivariate binary regression analysis found no significant association with mortality of the   above variables (p -value <0.05; C.I. 95%). PPU is a common finding among patients with   peritonitis undergoing emergency surgery at UTH and is associated w ith high mortality. Univariate   statistical analysis found Age, ASA score, Serum creatinine, Size of peptic ulcer perforation, HIV   Status and CD4 cell count level to be associated with mortality. However, no factor was found to   be significantly associated w ith mortality on multivariate regression analysis.    KEY WORDS : PPU,  30-Day post -operation  Mortality, Laparotomy              \n",

            "6    1.3.2  Application of the model to this study    The HBM endeavours to explain and predict health behaviours. This is made possible by focusing   on the attitudes and beliefs of individuals. In this study, the experiences of male partners had a   potential of positively influencing the quality of antenatal c are pregnant women received during the   antenatal period.    The services provided and made available could influence how male partners perceived antenatal   care. According to Rosenstock, 1974, the HBM is based on three assumptions; Firstly, it  assumes    that  a  person  will  take  a  health  related  action  if  that  person feels that a negative health   condition can be avoided. Secondly, there is an assumption that a person will take action if that   person has a positive expectation   and that, by   taking   a   recommended   action,   negative     health condition will be avoided. Lastly it further  assumes  that  a  person  takes  a  health  related    action  if  the person  believes  that  she/  he can  successfully  take  the  recommended action. The    HBM  ha s  six  constructs  as earlier outlined, which  represent  the  perceived  threats and  net   benefits.    a. Perceived severity       In this study, men with pregnant women would realize the susceptibility of their partners to maternal   complications of pregnancy. Therefore, they would realize the consequences of not engaging   themselves in Another  is because in the model,   a   person rec ognizes that she/he is susceptible to a   certain problem, and realizes the serious physical, psychological and social implications that may   follow (Rosenstock, 1974).    b. Perceived benefits    A  person  needs to  believe  that  by  taking  a  certain  action,  it   will  assist  her/him avoid or    prevent  a  problem  from  occurring. It  is  this  belief  which  gives  them confidence  to  take    action  because  they are  sure  of  the  results  (Rosenstock 1974).If men as individuals strongly   believe that involvin g themselves in ANC would enhance the maternal experience of their partners,   it is likely they will engage themselves in ANC and promote wellbeing of their partners.    It was therefore established in this study that male involvement in ANC enhanced the experience of   antenatal mothers . \n",

            "    v      phenomenology for  qualitative which required getting to know the lived experiences of   participants  more absolutely . Elements of correlation and narratives were employed to  establish   the relationship between leadership styles and conducive teaching and learning  environments in   colleges of study. Thus, four leadership styles , namely ; autocratic, democratic, laissez -faire and   instructional were investigated to determine the  extent to which they contribute to the  creation of   conducive teaching and learning  environments in colleges. The research engaged 372 participants   randomly  and purposively selected from principals, vice-principals, d irectors, Ministry of   Education officials, staff and students. Data were generated using questionnaires , interviews, focus   group d iscussion, o bservation and  docum ent analysis. Analysis of d ata was guided by positivism   paradigm and phenomenology . Statistica l Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 23   helped to analys e quantitative data whilst qualitative  was analys ed thematically. The Pearson   correlation and Chi square wer e used to assess the significance  levels of the variables  while Path -  goal and Fiedler ’s contingency theories guided the study.    The findings  highlighted  that there was a strong correlation between leadership styles and the   creation of conducive teaching and learning  environmen ts. Secondly , the findings  suggest  that   there was poor to moderate teaching and learning  environmen ts existing in colleges under all the   four leadership styles examined in this study . The statistical combining of these styles also showed   poor to moderate environment with negative implicati ons on teaching and learning . The  findings   further revealed that p rincipals were predominantly using autocratic and  to a small extent   democratic, laissez -faire and instructional  leadership styles which had  repercussions on how   colleges were  run and on crea tion of conducive teaching and learning  environments.  It can ,   therefore, be concluded that the four leadership styles studied have not positively contributed to   creation of conducive teaching and learning environments from the Zambian perspective . This has   repercussions on teaching and learning  taking place in colleges , as it implies that leadership styles   are not universal but their results premise on the context and way the style has been applied.     The study , therefore , recommends  that all principals s hould be  made  aware of the impact of their   style of leadership on teaching and learning . This thesis proposes the usage and adoption of hybrid    leadership style , which requires the blending of masculinity and femininity traits and   understanding of subordinates ’ behavio ur and attitudes in various situations to address the   challenges of leadership being experienced in the colleges . The study has developed the Vision ary   leaders, Dialogue initiator s, Cultural transforme rs, Interpersonal relationship builder s, Transparent   communicator s, and Team builder s and Resource provider  (VDCITTR) framework as  an   innovation to the current leadership styles prevailing in colleges today.  For further study , it is   recommended that research  be conducted  on various colleges  to analyse the suitabi lity of hybrid   leadership style and  the impact the style might have  on training being offered in Colleges  of   Education in Zambia .   Keywords: Conducive environment, leadership styles, teaching and learning .

            "V    Abstract    The study set out to investigate Decentralisation and Quality Education in  Community   schools in Mufulira and Kitwe Districts using Right -Based Approach to education; and    School -Family -Community Partnership Model  by Joyce Epstein. A descriptive survey   approach was used in this research and the sample comprised of 45 community sch ools   drawn from Mufulira and Kitwe districts, 45 head teachers, 100 teachers, 45 Parents   Community School Community Committee, two DEBS (Mufulira and Kitwe), three   officials from Non -Governmental Organisations, namely Zambia Open Community   Schools, the Fle mish Association for Development Cooperation and Technical   Assistance, and United States Aid Time To Learn project. The total sample was 195   participants. The statistical package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was engaged to analyze   quantitative data. Data wer e collected through questionnaires, interview guides, focused   group discussions, observations and document analysis of literature and institutional   records. The findings of the study showed that there were three types of curriculum used   in community school s namely, the Zambian curriculum of 2000, the skills, participation,   Access to Relevant Knowledge curriculum of 1996, and the Revised Curriculum of   2013. The majority of the teachers, that is 89 percent, indicated that they used revised   curriculum of 2013.  An examination of the Grade 7 results from community school   examination centres, for the period 2014 to 2017, showed that the performance of pupils   between those in the studied school and the government schools were similar. The   findings showed that resou rce mobilisation in community schools was a big challenge   because community schools were non -profit making organisations.  Resources were   mobilised mainly from the following: school fees; donations from cooperating partners   especially the United States Age ncy for International Development and The Flemish   Association for Development Cooperation and Technical Assistance; community   contributions; school fundraising ventures and the government. The structure for   resource mobilisation and utilisation was the Par ents Community School committees.   Community schools were monitored and evaluated by Resource Coordinators and senior   teachers of nearby schools. Out of 45 schools, the District Education Standards Officers   monitored only twelve schools. The study showed th at community schools enjoyed   some opportunities in the training of teachers in form of short pedagogical courses   organised by NGOs and cooperating partners through the government. This study found   out that community school pupils enjoyed the flexibility of fered by these schools in   terms of payment of schools fees, and school uniform policy. Administrative challenges   the schools faced were inadequate finances, inadequate infrastructure and learning and   teaching materials, and lack of trained teachers. In con clusion, community schools are   organized and managed by Parents Community School Committees thereby affording   the school managers an opportunity to innovate on activities responsive to their needs.   Monitoring of community schools though crucial to ensuring  quality education was   carried out by non -monitoring and evaluation specialists.        \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT    This study was aimed at ascertain ing the link between tobacco farming and the factors which   contribute to learner absenteeism in selected primary schools of Nkeyema District . The objectives   were to: analyse the factors which contribute to absenteeism of learners from tobacco and non -  tobacco farming homes in Nkeyema district, find out the stakeholders’ perceived effect of tobacco   farming on primary school learner absenteeism in Nkeyema district and to device measures for   addressing learner absenteeism in Nkeyema district . The study was qualitative in nature and had a   sample of 44 participants who were purposively selected from two primary schools in Nkeyema   District. These participants were selected  from class teachers, lea rners from both tobacco and non -  tobacco farming hom e backgrounds, tobacco and  non-tobacco farming parents from the   communities of the two selected schools. A descriptive design was employed a nd data was   collected using sermi - structured  interviews and focus group discussions. Data was  later analyzed   themat ically. The fin dings of the study revealed that the major factors which contributed to   absenteeism  among learners from both tobacco and non -tobacco farming homes were;  working in   tobacco activities, doing of house chores, long distances from homes to scho ols and lack of   encouragement by parents . The study also found out that tobacco farming had a negative effect on   learner absenteeism in Nkeyema District  in that it exacerbated the problem of long distances from   homes to school through the camp farming syst em, tobacco farming promoted the over dependence   on children to do house chores when parents were busy with farm works. Tobacco farming also   promoted c hild labour. The study suggested some remedies which can be used to reduce lea rner   absenteeism in Nkeyema  District. T hese were; parents to be providing their children with the   educational requirements as a way of motivating them to attend school, sensitize both parents and   their children on the importance of regular scho ol attendance, increase parents - teache rs   collaboration on matters affecting lea rners and that the tobacco farming companies operating in   Nkeyema District should work together with the school administrators to introduce mobile   education program for learners in the tobacco farming camps.       Key wo rds: Absenteeism, Farming,  Learners , Tobacco , Perceptions,  Parents .          \n",

            "V    ABSTRACT    This study investigated teacher representation in decision -making and its role in financial   decisions of selected grant aided secondary schools in Choma District, Zambia.  The objectives   were: to assess the areas in which teachers were involved in decision making; to establish levels   of teachers’ involvement in financial decision making among various categories; to ascertain the   major constraints of teachers’ representation in selected grant aided schools in Choma District.    The study employed  a descriptive d esign and Vroom -Yetton -Jago Contingency Theory of   participative decision making guided the study. Data was collected from a total sample size of 25   participants that comprised 5 head teachers, 15 teachers  and 5 head s of department. The   instruments of data collection used were interview guides containing semi -structured question   items.    The study revealed that teachers  were involved in academic decision making which included   drawing  the agenda for school meetings, selection of school prefects, and discipline of learners   but not directly involved in financial decision making. Heads of department were representatives   of teachers in financial decisions. The study also revealed that heads of  department and head   teachers’ involvement in decision making was higher and minimal for teachers. Further , the   study revealed lack of direct participation of teachers in financial decisions.      The study recommends that administrators in grant aided schoo ls should involve teachers in   financial decisions so as to enhance collective financial decision -making. The Ministry of   General Education should provide training to teachers in the form of workshops, seminars and so   on, in decision making, for them to bec ome competent, and skillful enough to participate in   financial decision -making and hence make the school efficient and effective in achieving its   objectives.  Head teachers should involve all education stakeholders to aid in school development   programmes an d projects. The schools should also initiate income generating projects to   subsidize government funding .      Key words : Decision making, Representation, Teachers.  \n",

            "      iv    ABSTRACT    The purpose of the s tudy was to evaluate the performance of the revised curriculum on the   provision of quality education in the selected public primary schools in Kazungula District of   Southern Province, Zambia. This research study had three objectives. The first one was to a ssess   how well the revised curriculum was performing in the provision of quality education. The second   objective was to identify the relationship between the revised curriculum and provision of quality   education and the third was to evaluate the revised cu rriculum impact on the provision of quality   education.    A descriptive research design was used in this study and data was analyzed using both quantitative   and qualitative approaches. In this study, the sixty - seven (67) sample size for this study comprised    02 ESOs from the District Education Board Office, 05)head teachers, 05 Deputy Head teachers,   10 senior teachers and 45 teachers from 05 government primary schools in Kazungula district. 45   Teachers were sampled using stratified random sampling. Simple ran dom sampling was used to   select 6 pupils and 20 teachers while purposeful sampling was used to select 4 school   administrators.    The major findings of the study were lack of quantity and quality of teaching staff to meet the   expectations of the pupils and th e society, and poor condition of service for curriculum   implementation. There was also shortage of teaching learning materials, 57.9% indicated that the   revised curriculum had impact on the provision of quality education in primary schools; it has   helped l earners to obtain computer literacy at an early age, it has compelled some teachers to   acquire computer literacy in order to cope with the new curriculum requirements.    Based on the findings of the study, four recommendations were given. There was need to c ontinue   the construction of more primary schools especially in rural areas and this could be accompanied   by the construction of more classrooms so as to address the problem of teacher pupil ratio. There   was need to provide quality teaching and learning mat erials. These could be enough so as to   address the problem of book pupil ratio. More teachers could also be trained in handling   technological subjects. There is also need to reorient teachers on how to deliver the content of the   revised curriculum in the c lassroom.     \n",

            " vi    ABSTRACT    Although there is government concern about women opportunities in formal education at all   levels, the representation of women in school administrative positions is still inadequate as   compared to men . Thus, t his research work wa s a case study aimed at investigating gender gaps   in school administrative positions  in Chilanga  district. Its main objective were  to assess the   gender gaps in school administrative positions with regards to rural and urban schools in   Chilanga district.     The literature reviewed showed the prevalence of gender gap s in education and their   consequence on economic growth. The literature reviewed supports two obvious policy   recommendations: increasing women‟s access to education and promote their  participation in   decision making  positions , this includes administrative p ositions in education sector.    Qualitative methods were used to collect and analyze data from 70 participants who were   selected purposively and randomly . This included, the district education board secretary, 2   Senior Education Standard Off icers ( ESO) , 2 top management officials from HR department, 20   school administrators, 5 PTA chairpersons , and  40 Teachers (20 males and 20 females)   respectively . Data from one to one  semi -structured interviews  and questionnaire s were   thematically analysed. Presentatio ns of the findings were done using tables , direct quotations and    simple narrations.    However, t he findings of the study revealed  that the  current situation of gender gaps  in   administrative  positions in both rural and urban schools was as a result of  male  domina nce in   administrative positions and qualities  for school administrators. Motivation was found to be a   leading factor in the current changes in gender gaps in school administrative positions. Gender \n",

            "v       Climate scenarios were generated using LARS -WG and AgMIP protocols . The   suitability of LARS -WG in generating current and future climate scenarios was   evaluated using CMIP3 HadCM3 and BCM2 global climate models (GCMs) for B1   and A1B scenarios. The current (1980 -2010) and future (2040 -2070) climate scenarios   used as inputs into the CSM s were generated using 5 GCMs (E, I, K, O, R)  and RCPs    (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 ) scenarios using the AgMIP protocols. APSIM -Maize and   CERES -Maize models were used to evaluate maize yield to response to PD, N, cultivar    and climate scenarios  assuming constant m anagement. Future changes in phenology    and yield were estimated as the difference between future and baseline period.       Extreme precipitation (PRCPTOT, R30 mm, RX5day, R95pTOT) indices were   statistically non -significant. Mount Makulu warming are due to incr ease in mean and   maximum temperature . LARS -WG projected an increase in temperature (Observed   station data [1.50oC (B1: 2050), 1.84oC (A1B: 2050)], AgMERRA data [1.48oC (B1:   2050), 1.84oC (A1B: 2050)]) and variability in precipitation.  The projected ensemble   mean annual temperature using the AgMIP protocols is expected to increase by 1.82°C   (RCP4.5) and 2.48oC (RCP8.5). However, rainfall is projected to decrease by 1.46%   (RCP4.5) and 1.91% (RCP8.5). APSIM -Maize and CERES -Maize models simulated   fewer  DAP to anthesis and maturity  relative to the baseline . Maize grain yield (-6.90 -   +4.06 (RCP4.5), -10.80 - +5.00% (RCP8.5) [APSIM -Maize]; -0.59 to +25.77%   (RCP4.5) and -6.52 to +20.21% (RCP8.5) [CERES -Maize] ) would decrease or   increase relative to the basel ine. PD, N, and rainfall  would affect future grain yield .      The simulated versus observed values of DAP to anthesis, and maturity, grain yield,   grain size, and grain number m-2 and soil water content had normalized root mean   square error < 20% and d -stat > 0.71. The models can be used to predict phenology   and yield . Using an ensemble mean of the CSMs, DAP to anthesis ( -11.28 to -9.39%   [RCP4.5]; -14.28 to -12.65% [RCP8.5]) and maturity ( -10.52 to -9.43% [RCP4.5]; -  14.01 to -12.75% [RCP8.5]) would reduce in 2 050. The % change in grain would range   from 2.78 to 9.94%, -3.81 to -8.88% and -2.33 to 10.63% under N1, N , and N3,   respectively. Grain yield would increase/or decrease with delay in PD (RCP4.5 [PD1   = 2.57%; PD2=3.31%; PD3=4.37%]; RCP8.5 [PD1 = -1.11%; PD2 =-0.29%;   PD3=1.08%]). The current PDs and cultivars with lower N (N1) would increase grain   yield in  future. However, grain yield would increase with higher N (N3) at PD3.       To establish credibility in CSM s for use at  a local scale, they have to be adequately   calibrated and validated. The calibration and validation of APSIM -Maize and CERES -  Maize models were necessary for their application to new cultivars to minimize   uncertainty. C SMs can be used to simulate probable outc omes in crop management   strategies, N fertilizer rate, PD and impact of climate change on crop growth and yield.   Earlier PDs with lower N would lead to an increase in grain yield than at higher N.   Proposed i mprovements in the CSM s are phenological stage du ration and LAI   prediction under subtropical environment s. The mitigation and adaptation strategies   for CC includes changing PDs, N management, cultivar selection, water managemen t,   and tillage practices.  Future model evaluations may be needed for new cultivars.

            "iv    ABSTRACT       In Zambia, many smallholder farmers achieve household food security through the production of   maize ‘zea  mays’.  During the years of maize failure due to drought, there is need for other crops to   enhance food security like Orange Fleshed Sweet Potato. Since the 2010/2011 farming season, the   Orange Fleshed Sweet Potato has been integrated in the farming syste m of the smallholder farmers   of Eastern Province to help the household food security.    The aim of this study was on the diffusion of the Orange Fleshed Sweet Potato and its contribution   to the household food security and livelihoods of the smallholder farme rs in Petauke District of   Eastern Province in Zambia. The specific objectives were: i, To establish the diffusion of the   OFSP;ii, To assess the contributions of the OFSP to household food security in ; iii, To find out the   livelihoods improvement for smallh older farmer households and iv, To identify the challenges   smallholder farmers face in the growing of the OFSP . A questionnaire was used to collect data from   a purposively selected sample of 118Orange Fleshed Smallholder farmers. Key informants and two   Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were used to triangulate data from the questionnaire. The analysis   of quantitative data was done by the aid of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 20).   This helped to come up with percentages presented in statistic al tables and graphs.    The innovation was introduced in Petauke in 2010/2011 farming season by the International Potato   Centre. In 2011/2012; 76.3% smallholder farmers adopted the crop while in 2012/2013; 6.7%   additional smallholder farmers adopted and in the 2013/2014; 16.9% respondents adopted.  The   diffusion of the Orange Fleshed Sweet Potatoes was through hierarchical diffusion which was   expansion in nature. The pillars of food security met were food availability and access.    The crop contributed to the household food security because the adopters had additional food from   the OFSP. The livelihoods of the people improved because they were able to raise money to by   household goods and managed to buy family goods and services. The challenges the farmers face d   were the acquisition of vines for planting, diseases, pests and difficulties in preservation. The other   challenge was lack or insufficient different types of capitals like physical, financial, and social. A   lot of opportunities exist for the OFSP because  the crop was viable as it contributed to their   livelihood that they could buy farming implements and inputs for other crops like maize from the   money earned after selling the harvest.       Key words : innovation, diffusion, food security, orange fleshed sweet potatoes , livelihood, capital                       \n",

            "   iii    ABSTRACT       This research examines the policy and legislat ive framework  on investment expropriation in   Zambia, against international law i nstruments. It outlines the investment policy and law on   investment expropriation at the international, regional and national levels. Finally, this   research identifies the gaps in the expropriation policy and legisl ation in Zambia in relation to   international investment l aw instruments and assesses whether the policy and law benefit   both the Zambian citizen s and investors. The main question investigated in this research was   whether the investment  expropriation  policy and l aw in Zambia contains any gaps, and to   determine the extent to which these gaps could be sealed in order for the policy and law to   have tangible benefits to the Zambians. The research employed a social legal  approach to   analyse the policy and legislative f ramework on investment expropriation in Zambia. The   methods of d ata collection w ere triangulated between secondary and primary data  collection   methods , as a way of broadening the scope of investigation. Secondary data collection   included consultations of a  wide range of documents. Sources of data included United   Nations General Assembl y Resolutions and Instruments, A rticles from journals, books,   internet materials and so on. Primary data included administration of an interview guides to a   cross section of R espondents. The Respondents were purposively selected based on their   expertise. Interviews were both formal and guided by interview guides. Formal interviews   were tape recorded and later transcribed and analysed, using thematic analysis techniques.   The mai n findings of this research are as follows:  (a) the Zambian policy on  investment    expropriation is not in line with international i nvestment expropriation policy. On the other   hand, the legislative framework reviewed is in line with international investment    expropriation law save for the Mines and Minerals Development which has no provision on   investment expropriation ; (b) s econdly, the policy on investment expropriation as contained   in the 7NDP, RSNDP  and MRD  Policy  are too broad and addresses investment in general,   thereby creating gaps; and  (c) thirdly, the law as contained in the Zambia Development   Agency, Mining and, Land acquisition are not comprehensive enough to achieve the   objectives set under international law, thus creating gaps between internationa l law   expectations and national law and further that it does not differentiate between the two   opposing concepts of expropriation and regulation. The  research notes that investment policy   and legislation in Zambia on expropriation is inadequate though some  of the key policy   considerations and principles of international investment law appears to have been   domesticated to a certain extent. The research recommends that there is need for government   to come up with a comprehensive investment policy and law on e xpropriation that takes into   account Zambian history and capacity as a nation, as well as differentiating between the two   opposing concepts of expropriation and regulation.          KEY WORDS: Compensation, expropriation, investment , public interest, regulation.                 \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT          HIV/AIDS remains a major challenge particularly among women of child bearing   age. Globally, there are about 36.6 million people living with HIV infection and   about 70 % (25 million) of these live in sub -Saharan Africa .  HIV burden needs   greater attention  in the planning of EMTCT programmes. This study aimed at   determining the possible risks and the prevalence of HIV seroconversion in pregnant   women of Southern province in Zambia from 2012 to 2016. Also to assess adherence   to the recommended number of HIV tests. It was imperative to undertake this study   as the results would provide important insights to policy makers and for other   important decisions in an effort to reduce HIV seroconversion in pregnant women.    This was a retrospective cohort study design. Data was obtained from the Smart Care   data base in the department of Information Technology at Ministry of Health   Headquarters in Lusaka.  Cross tabulations were used to determine associations and   logistic regression analysis was used to determine the best  predictors at p -value less   than 0.05 and 95% confidence interval. Chi square for trends was used to assess the   trend of HIV seroconversion prevalence.   Complete case analysis was used to take   care of missing data.   Data was missing completely at random an d the missing values   were d istributed across all variables thus this was the suitable method.    From the study population (n=3,489), 242 seroconverted, giving an overall   prevalence of 6.9%.   The p -value (0.035) for trend analysis was statistically   significan t. There was no evidence of association for  marital status and partner HIV   test. Those with primary education had 91% reduced risk (p -value 0.02, CI 0.01 -  0.68) and those with secondary education had 85% reduced risk of seroconverting (p -  value 0.05, CI 0.02 -1.01). These were statistically significant at multivariable   analysis.   148 (6.3%) of those married seroconverted . Majority (86.2%) of the study   participants had two HIV tests.  The trend for HIV seroconversion in pregnant women   of Southern province was do wnwards from 2015 to 2016.   Primary and secondary   education levels were independently significant factors associated with HIV   seroconversion.  Adherence to the recommended number of HIV tests was poor as   majority of participants only had two tests .   Key ter ms: HIV Seroconversion, Elimination of Mother to Child Transmission   (EMTCT), Antenatal Care (ANC), Smart Care data . \n",

            "      v    ABSTRACT    Conservation Agriculture (CA) has widely been promoted by government through t he   Conservation Farming Unit of the Zambia National Farmers Union and non-governmental   organizations such as Land Mana gement and Conservation Farming Project, the Golden   Valley A gricultural Research Trust , the Institute of Agricultural and Environmental   Engineering Project, the Cooperative League of the USA, World Vision and various donors to   address problems of low crop yields and food insecurity among smallholder farmers in   Zamb ia. Despite the increasing interest and funding in CA, its disadoption among smallholder   farmers is common especially after the end of CA projects. Several studies have been   undertaken on the adoption of CA but few studies have been conducted on the factor s that   lead to disadoption of CA. Thus, this study identifies factors that contribute to disadoption of   CA and opportunities for reducing disadoption among smallholder farmers in Petauke District   of Zambia.       The data was collected from 92 randomly selecte d smallholder farming households using   questionnaires; in -depth interviews with seven purposively selected key informants and four   focus group discussions. Qualitative data was analyzed by thematic and content analysis and   quantitative data was analyzed by  chi-square and a binary regression. Results show that 29   percent of smallholder farmers disadopted CA. CA basins were the most disadopted due to   their labour intensiveness. The four most commonly cited factors leading to disadoption of   CA as reported by smallholder farmers are lack of farm transport for manure (31 percent),   high labour demand (25 percent), lack of adequate knowledge in CA (16 percent), a nd lack of   free incentives (16 percent). Chi -square analysis showed significant association between each   of the following factors with disadoption of CA: labour intensity; lack of access to free   incentives; lack of farm transport for manure and poor local CA leadership. Regression results   showed that lack of transport for manure; lack of adequate knowledge in CA; location and   lack of free incentives (material items given) contributed significantly towards increased   likelihood of CA disadoption at 0.05 level  of significance. From the smallholder farmers‟   perception s, options for reducing the disadoption of CA were increased access to free   incentives including herbicides; enhance CA training; increase access to transportation of   manure; provision of CA equipme nt and good local CA leadership.       Thus this study concludes that most of the factors that influence disadoption involve the   attitude  of the farmers, dependency on incentives, labour constraints, poor rapport between the   local CA leadership and smallholder farmers, and lack of essential CA assets. This study   recommends that CA promoters, donors and government should help smallholder farmers to   become self -reliant, reduce their provision of free agricultural inputs and enhance CA   trainings to smallholder farm ers so as to minimize disadoption of the technology. Introduction   of CA in communities should be based on scientific evidence rather than material incentives.                 \n",

            "     vi    ABSTRACT    Worldwide, over two thirds of human waste is released into the environment with little or no   treatment. This later results in the  deterioration of the urban environment in form of air, water, and   land pollution that poses risks to human health and the environment. In the developing world,   urbanization implies the expansion of existing slum areas and the mushrooming of new ones. The   provision of solid waste management services in Zambia’s Kanyama settlement, a slum area in the   capital city Lusaka has proved to be a challenge which has been worsened and exacerbated by the   lack of community engagement resulting in indiscriminate disposa l of waste on the streets, empty   spaces, ditches, drainages and streams. The purpose of this study is to explore ways to promote   community participation in solid waste management using participatory action research.    The study employed qualitative particip atory action research methods. Data was collected using   Photo Voice as a core method with 3 Focus Group Discussions. A meandering Transect walk was   conducted with 12 participants and 10 Key Informant Interviews. Data was analyzed using   thematic analysis. Q ualitative data analysis for photo voice involved an iterative, multi -stage,   collaborative process between the participants and researcher.     The participatory study revealed that ward ten is grappling with major solid waste challenges, the   community is li ttered with hip and hips of uncollected garbage, clogged drainage and strong stench   coming from the uncollected garbage and over flowing pit latrines and swamps in the   neighborhood.  The study further unearthed illegal solid waste management practices and   behaviors that residents have adopted over the years which has prevented them from subscribing   to waste collection services. Illegal dumpsites have been created by residents in the community    Community led and community participation has long been accepted  as the only sustainable   process of ensuring long lasting and permanent positive change in the urban poor communities.   The study explored community participation the inward ten of Kanyama, the findings point out to   the fact that the lack of community led a pproaches to solid waste management  as well as practices   and attitudes adopted by the community over the years have allowed continued indiscriminate   disposal of waste. As a community action oriented study these findings are not only relevant for   planning,  implementation purposes, the findings also authoritatively point out of the residents ‘s   demands for revision of the legislative and policy environment in solid waste management in the   country .  The study also points the need for vigorous and massive com munity engagement for the   residents   to begin to change their mindset regarding waste in the community. The findings of this   study further emphasize the importance of embracing community friendly and community led   innovative ways of tackling of solid wast e.

            "v    ABSTRACT    Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a disorder of dev elopment characterised by marked   impairments in social interaction, communication, and restricted repetitive and stereotyped   patterns of behavior. It is considered to be a severe disability because of its persistent lifelong   effects on the affected individ ual and his or her family.  A number of researches report that   parents of children with ASD show higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression than those   of normally developing children. Therefore, families’ coping mechanisms need to be   explored so that health care workers can tap from them in order to help other parents.    Nevertheless there is very little understanding of how families adapt and support each other   in such situations.    The general objective of this study was to explore adaptation patterns of  family members   caring for a child with ASD at UTH and Bauleni Special schools  in Lusaka  according to   Virginia Henderson’s Activities of Daily Living  (ADL) .   Qualitative methodology utilising an interpretive phenomenological approach was used on a   sample of eighteen family members who were selected using purposive sampling. Data were   collected through individual in -depth interviews and a single focus group discussion (FGD).   van Manen’s six steps of analysis were  used to analyse data.    Three major themes , namel y: Perceived sources of parental distress; Experiences and beliefs;   and A ccommodating the needs of a child with ASD, emerged from the data. The major   themes were supported by several subthemes.  The implications of the findings on practice are   that most parents were greatly distressed by their children’s behavioural disorders and made   significant adaptation changes in order to cope with the situation.  Delays in diagnosis   occurred due to lack of knowledge of ASD amongst health care workers and negative cultur al   beliefs resulting into  late school placement.  It was also noted that the ability for families to   accommodate their child with ASD affected their adaptation.    It is therefore recommended that health workers utilise successful adaptation patterns to help   parents and families with a child with ASD.

            "v    ABSTRACT       The objective of this study was to assess the factors that influence the level of E -tax systems   adoption in Zambia and how E -tax can be enhanced. The study focused on TaxOnline  system   used by domestic taxes division in Zambia. The study was conducted in Solwezi town of   Zambia. In this study, the researcher used Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The   sample size was purposively selected from various taxpayers who were coming thro ugh to   Zambia Revenue Authority Solwezi internet bureau. 100 semi structured survey   questionnaires were distributed with 100% response. The data collected was analyzed using   descriptive statistics.  The Pearson correlation coefficient and P -values were used  to determine   the relationship between variables.  The results showed that, E -tax system in Zambia is useful,   easy to use and also secure . Based on the findings, majority of the taxpayers are filing their   returns and paying taxes online. However, there are few taxpayers who still feel E -tax is not   useful, easy to use and secure. Therefore, more awareness and taxpayer education must   continue to bring everyone on board. E -Tax involves E -Filing and E -Payment which is the   process of submitting returns over the i nternet using an approved E -Tax system. Adoption is   the action or fact of choosing to take up or follow something. Technology Acceptance Model   is an information system theory that models how users come to accept and use a technology.   TaxOnline is a system used in Zambia to file returns and pay taxes online.       Keywords    E-Tax, Adoption, Technology A cceptance model, TaxOnline      \n",

            "\t\t\t  \tvi\tABSTRACT Company registers are increasingly becoming a crucial source of business information for many stakeholders. While most company registers have concentrated on simplifying business registrations, reducing the number of procedures, time and cost for small entities to be formed, compliance remains a big challenge for many Company Registers. Compliance is not just influenced by economic variables of enforcement and penalties but should be understood in the context of behaviour as influenced by demographic, socio-economic and Institutional factors. The aim of this study was to identify and explain the factors influencing compliance behaviour in filing company annual returns based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour in Zambia. The study used a mixed research approach. A sample of 165 registered companies was randomly selected from the population of 68,049 active companies on the PACRA register. Nine PACRA officers were selected using judgment sampling and in-depth interviews were used.  Primary data were collected through structured questionnaires. The secondary data were also collected by reviewing related published and unpublished materials.  Statistical tests of independence (chi-square tests) formed the basis of analysis.  The results of this study showed that annual return filings are influenced both by demographic and external factors. The demographic factors like employment status, Age and education were found to positively influence compliance. Further, compliance was highest (68%) among those with tertiary education compared with (47%) among those with no form of schooling. The study also revealed that those in formal employment were more compliant (64%) than those without employment (47%).  Gender was found to be an insignificant factor and such it has no influence on compliance. On external factors, cultural norms, government policies and compliance fees were identified in the study and were found to have an influence on compliance (save for compliance fees). Finally, the findings of the study may guide government institutions that spend huge costs on enforcement year in year out but it is not so effective and that low penalty fees do not all the time cause voluntary compliance. Further, before Institutions implement costly sensitization campaigns and educational clinics, they need to understand variables that cause compliance behaviour. The study findings can help Policy makers and PACRA meeting its strategic goals of raising compliance levels which currently stand at 40% to about 70%.   KEY WORDS: Compliance, Annual Returns, Company Register, Theory of Planned Behaviour, Demographic factors, external factors \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT       Narratologists concede  that every narrative  has an agency who conveys the story. This is   the speaker that recounts events  as one listens to the story. Voice is an integral aspect in   narrative analysis. The study  aimed at analysing the similarities and differences in the use   of narrative voice in  the novels  Stillborn  and Allah Is Not Obliged . These were evaluated   in order to establish their significance to the narrative system of the two texts. The   qualitative approach was utilised and the study was a desk research . The p rimary texts   were purposefully sampled as they are both historical fiction al works  told by narrators   who po rtray how political turmoil such as  war in their respective societies wounds their   psych e. A close comparative reading of the two text was conducted. Secondary data from   articles, journals, books and electronic sources were examined mainly using the theory  of   narratology buttressed by the psychoanalytical literary theory. Findings were that in both   texts, the narration is done retrospectively by several homodiegetic voices but Seun, a   peripheral character is more audible in Stillborn  whereas Allah Is Not Ob liged  is   dominantly told by an autodiegetic narrator Birahima.  Retrospective narrations  are   important as they  enable the narrators to reflect on past events and  examine  their inner   thoughts before narrating . Homodiegetic narra tors are believable since  they recount what   they witness to a certain degree.  The peripheral homodiegetic  narrator  exhibits sympathy   towards the protagonists while the autodiegetic narrator recounts with depth as a victim    of war , revealing his damaged psyche  more than the observing narrator . Narrative   embedding though more extensive in Stillborn  is a vital artistic strategy used to develop   themes, characterisation, create diversity, suspense and harmony in both texts. The   functions of the narrator according to Genette’s  (1980)  model are all carried out by the   overarching narrators. It is mainly through Seun’s and Birahima’s  perspect ive that the   tales are narrated . In directing the story, Birahima often pauses the story and time while   Seun recounts continually.  This demonstrates how va ryingly narrators can manipulate the   narrative’s flow. Through the communicative function , they  confess their repressed   emotional wounds and desires  to the narratee . Their childhood experiences play a pivotal   role in shaping the narratives.  They also attest to what they recount but Birahima   authenticates his account further by swearing. Testify ing render s the narrators believable   to the narratee.  Political  mayhems,  ethnic and religious conflict  are condemned through   ideas the narrators commu nicate . This is essential to the development of themes.  That   both narrators are also  narratees contributes to the construction of the matrix  narratives   since they graft the received tales to them .   Key words: Narratology, narrative voice, significance, homo diegetic .    \n",

            "v    ABSTRACT    Introduction    The burden of Tuberculosis (TB) in Zambia is one of the highest in the world. The incidence of   TB has risen in recent years, partly as a result of the impact of the HIV and AIDS   epidemic. Therefore, Diagnostic Counselling and Testing (DCT) was  recommended as part of the   treatment package of tuberculosis patient.This will help improve the patient‟s quality of life,   delaying and preventing complications and deaths due to opportunistic infections that could arise   from late detection of HIV/AIDS.Di agnostic Counselling and Testing can best be achieved by   information, communication and education to  patients with Tuberculosis( TB) on the importance   of testing early.  The objective of the study was to examine the utilization of DCT and associated   factors among patients with TB at Monze Mission Hospital in Southern province of Zambia.    Methods: An institutional -based cross -sectional study was conducted at Monze Mission Hospital   chest clinic. Simple random sampling method was used to select in/out patients wi th tuberculosis   from within the hospital.Data was collected from patients who consented for enrolment from   October to December 2014.  A semi-structured interview schedule was used to collect data. The   relationships between the different categories of variab les were investigated using Pearson‟s Chi   squar ed test for association and further fitting logistic regression model. The independent   variables were determined to be significantly associated with the outcome variables after   bivariate Chi -square testing wer e included into the logistic regression model.  Binary logistic   regression analysis of data was carried out using IBM® SPSS®Statistics for Windows version   20.0 to predict factors influencing DCT.    Results: A total of 226 patients were sampled and out of which, 150  (66.7%) did not utilize DCT   and 76 (33.3%) utilized DCT . Diagnostic Testing and Counselling was a associated with the level   of knowledge and confidentiality.  The p value of level of knowledge and confidentiality were   less than 0.05 and therefore failed to reject the null hypothesis. Multivariate binary logistic   regression model predicted that confidentiality and knowledge were associated with DCT at p   value < 0.05        \n",

            "    6 1.4 Conceptual Framework    This study  used pearlin’s stress -process model of stress in car ers (Pearlin et al, 1990). The model   was applicable in the factors associated with psychological distress among mothers with preterm   babies at the MNH Neona tal Intensive Care Unit. It  guide d the study by investigating the   background factors, primary stress ors, secondary stressors, and mediating variables to   understand their impact on psychological distress.   The model was designed to assess the   informal caregiving processes affecting caregiver health.    The model was generally applicable to all caregiving s ituations (Myers, 2003). It depicted  four   domains of the str ess process. The first domain was  the background and context of the stress.   The domain includes factors such as socio -economic, family network and personal history. The   age, gender, race, educatio n level and marital status of the caregiver was described as   components under this factor. All these factors were  associated to psychological distress.    The co nstruct of background/context was  included to address the setting in which caregiving   takes place , with emphasis on the social and economic characteristics of the fam ily.   Socioeconomic resources  helped to contain the extent to which a patient’s condition becomes   burdensome. The socioeconomic factors were  determined using measures of parental education ,   occupation and family income (American Psychological Associat ion, 2016). Personal history had    two components, the number of health conditions, and the caregiver relation type. The second   and third domains were  conceptualized as primary and secondary  in nature. The second domain   was the primary stressor.    Pearlin and colleagues defined stressors as the problematic conditions and difficult   circumstances experienced by caregiver that strain or supersede the individual’s capacity to adapt   (Pearlin et al 1990) . The primary stressors are linked directly to the individual receiving care.    There are three components in this domain, recipient behavior, recipient care needs and the   subjective stress. In this domain, diagnosis, length of time since diagnosis, depressi ve behaviors,   and problems with activities of daily living are said to contribute to psy chological distress on the   carer. Th e third domain was  the secondary role strains.  \n",

            "\t\t\t  \tvi\tABSTRACT Company registers are increasingly becoming a crucial source of business information for many stakeholders. While most company registers have concentrated on simplifying business registrations, reducing the number of procedures, time and cost for small entities to be formed, compliance remains a big challenge for many Company Registers. Compliance is not just influenced by economic variables of enforcement and penalties but should be understood in the context of behaviour as influenced by demographic, socio-economic and Institutional factors. The aim of this study was to identify and explain the factors influencing compliance behaviour in filing company annual returns based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour in Zambia. The study used a mixed research approach. A sample of 165 registered companies was randomly selected from the population of 68,049 active companies on the PACRA register. Nine PACRA officers were selected using judgment sampling and in-depth interviews were used.  Primary data were collected through structured questionnaires. The secondary data were also collected by reviewing related published and unpublished materials.  Statistical tests of independence (chi-square tests) formed the basis of analysis.  The results of this study showed that annual return filings are influenced both by demographic and external factors. The demographic factors like employment status, Age and education were found to positively influence compliance. Further, compliance was highest (68%) among those with tertiary education compared with (47%) among those with no form of schooling. The study also revealed that those in formal employment were more compliant (64%) than those without employment (47%).  Gender was found to be an insignificant factor and such it has no influence on compliance. On external factors, cultural norms, government policies and compliance fees were identified in the study and were found to have an influence on compliance (save for compliance fees). Finally, the findings of the study may guide government institutions that spend huge costs on enforcement year in year out but it is not so effective and that low penalty fees do not all the time cause voluntary compliance. Further, before Institutions implement costly sensitization campaigns and educational clinics, they need to understand variables that cause compliance behaviour. The study findings can help Policy makers and PACRA meeting its strategic goals of raising compliance levels which currently stand at 40% to about 70%.   KEY WORDS: Compliance, Annual Returns, Company Register, Theory of Planned Behaviour, Demographic factors, external factors \n",

            "iv       ABSTRACT       The study examined the use of play parks in Lusaka City. Lusaka incorporated play parks in   its city’s plan based on Ebenezer Howard’s ‘Garden City’ Concept as a way of beautifying   the city and benefit ing from a number of attributes relating to people’s mental health , social,   environmental, physical and economic life. Despite these immense benefits, it is not clear    how people use play parks in Lusaka C ity. T hus, this  study  sought to find out how people in    Lusaka City utilise play parks and establish the factors which influence their use.  The study   further examined the extent to which people used play parks in the city and whether there   were differences  in this use across different segments of the urban population , seeing that   there is no policy  guiding play park services  in Zambia.  The three play parks  which were   selected for this study were  Joy Park and Gardens , located  in Matero, Libala Play Park in   Libala Stage II and Havillah Play Park and Gard ens in Rhodes Park. A case s tudy approach   was followed , using both qualitative and quantit ative data collection methods. Semi -  structured i ntervie ws were conducted with ten key informants who were purposively   sampled , while a questionnaire survey was used to collect data from f orty-five play park   visitors who were  conveniently sampled . Qualitative data w as analysed using thematic  and   content analysis , whereas quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics. The study   findings indicate that play parks in Lusaka City are used for social, spiritual, economical ,   physical activity  and bio -diversity  reasons . The study findings show  that people’s use of play   parks is mainly determined by the quality of a play park  (44.1%) , availabil ity of facilities   (10.1%), accessibility  (7.3%) and safety of a play park  (11%). O thers (27.5%) visit play parks   because of the natural and undisturbed environment found at the play park which offers them   escape (refug ee) from fast paced urban life and an opportunity to reflect. The main users of   play parks are f amilies, school -going children and college students, work groups and   religious groups. These groups of people utilis e play parks based on their levels of education,   occupation and income stat us. The study findings show that people from Medium Density   Areas use play parks the most and the majority  of play park visitors are in formal   employment. Further,  most play park visitors have either secondary education (51.1%) or   tertiary education (35.1% ). Lusaka City Council (LCC)  has leased all its play p arks to the    private sector , but t he lack of policy on the use of play parks has adversely affected the   efficiency  and effective ness in running  these play parks. The study recommends the   formulation of p olicy to clearly set out rules and expectations for the delivery of play park   services to the public.

            "v    ABSTRACT    The value expectations of Information Technology (IT) for socio -economic and human   development in developing countries have been high, but the real benefits and the positive impacts   have been somewhat disappointing. Most developing countries in Africa are at the eme rging stage   of e-government development and lag far behind developed nations despite having had national e -  government strategies in place for a considerable period of time.  The harsh socio -economic and   infrastructural context makes the sustainability of a n Information System (IS) a major issue.   Technology transfer to Africa has been too dependent on external factors, like international donor   aid, and emphasized on technology itself.    Despite government and public sector entities allocating huge sums on the ir budgets into   Information Systems implementations with an objective to ameliorate service delivery, promote   accountability and transparency and improve overall operations, benefit and value realization from   these investments are hardly achieved . There is  a need for locally developed, appropriate   information systems, which are based on local needs and structures. This research argues that the   Information systems acquisition, development and implementations should be done using   appropriate methods in a Zamb ian (African) context based on local needs and structures. The   research has been done by surveying 5 public interest user companies in Zambia, literature review   in information systems acquisition, development and implementations in South Africa, Kenya,   Nigeria, India and in the context of developing and developed countries.    The Information systems acquisition, development and implementations in Zambia is ambitious,   and capable of providing solutions for local companies, but the resources for investments are   scarce. In Zambia, low I.T Infrastructure, People, Technology and poor implementation approach   are some of the identified hindrances to the growth of the sector. Human capital requirements   require further nurturing and mindset change of citizens to begin to appreciate locally designed    and produced  products and services.  Appreciating our baby steps and the need to exercise patience   to nurture our talents at our budding stage in information systems development and implementation   as we acquire information systems will ameliorate the growth of the sector . The study provides a   model, (The Acquisition, Development and Implementation Framework; ADIF)  for effective and   efficient implementation of Information systems  and ensure benefits realization of Information   systems investments . \n",

The   suitability of LARS -WG in generating current and future climate scenarios was   evaluated using CMIP3 HadCM3 and BCM2 global climate models (GCMs) for B1   and A1B scenarios. The current (1980 -2010) and future (2040 -2070) climate scenarios   used as inputs into the CSM s were generated using 5 GCMs (E, I, K, O, R)  and RCPs    (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 ) scenarios using the AgMIP protocols. APSIM -Maize and   CERES -Maize models were used to evaluate maize yield to response to PD, N, cultivar    and climate scenarios  assuming constant m anagement. Future changes in phenology    and yield were estimated as the difference between future and baseline period.       Extreme precipitation (PRCPTOT, R30 mm, RX5day, R95pTOT) indices were   statistically non -significant. Mount Makulu warming are due to incr ease in mean and   maximum temperature . LARS -WG projected an increase in temperature (Observed   station data [1.50oC (B1: 2050), 1.84oC (A1B: 2050)], AgMERRA data [1.48oC (B1:   2050), 1.84oC (A1B: 2050)]) and variability in precipitation.  The projected ensemble   mean annual temperature using the AgMIP protocols is expected to increase by 1.82°C   (RCP4.5) and 2.48oC (RCP8.5). However, rainfall is projected to decrease by 1.46%   (RCP4.5) and 1.91% (RCP8.5). APSIM -Maize and CERES -Maize models simulated   fewer  DAP to anthesis and maturity  relative to the baseline . Maize grain yield (-6.90 -   +4.06 (RCP4.5), -10.80 - +5.00% (RCP8.5) [APSIM -Maize]; -0.59 to +25.77%   (RCP4.5) and -6.52 to +20.21% (RCP8.5) [CERES -Maize] ) would decrease or   increase relative to the basel ine. PD, N, and rainfall  would affect future grain yield .      The simulated versus observed values of DAP to anthesis, and maturity, grain yield,   grain size, and grain number m-2 and soil water content had normalized root mean   square error < 20% and d -stat > 0.71. The models can be used to predict phenology   and yield . Using an ensemble mean of the CSMs, DAP to anthesis ( -11.28 to -9.39%   [RCP4.5]; -14.28 to -12.65% [RCP8.5]) and maturity ( -10.52 to -9.43% [RCP4.5]; -  14.01 to -12.75% [RCP8.5]) would reduce in 2 050. The % change in grain would range   from 2.78 to 9.94%, -3.81 to -8.88% and -2.33 to 10.63% under N1, N , and N3,   respectively. Grain yield would increase/or decrease with delay in PD (RCP4.5 [PD1   = 2.57%; PD2=3.31%; PD3=4.37%]; RCP8.5 [PD1 = -1.11%; PD2 =-0.29%;   PD3=1.08%]). The current PDs and cultivars with lower N (N1) would increase grain   yield in  future. However, grain yield would increase with higher N (N3) at PD3.       To establish credibility in CSM s for use at  a local scale, they have to be adequately   calibrated and validated. The calibration and validation of APSIM -Maize and CERES -  Maize models were necessary for their application to new cultivars to minimize   uncertainty. C SMs can be used to simulate probable outc omes in crop management   strategies, N fertilizer rate, PD and impact of climate change on crop growth and yield.   Earlier PDs with lower N would lead to an increase in grain yield than at higher N.   Proposed i mprovements in the CSM s are phenological stage du ration and LAI   prediction under subtropical environment s. The mitigation and adaptation strategies   for CC includes changing PDs, N management, cultivar selection, water managemen t,   and tillage practices.  Future model evaluations may be needed for new cultivars.

Thus, t his research work wa s a case study aimed at investigating gender gaps   in school administrative positions  in Chilanga  district. Its main objective were  to assess the   gender gaps in school administrative positions with regards to rural and urban schools in   Chilanga district.     The literature reviewed showed the prevalence of gender gap s in education and their   consequence on economic growth. The literature reviewed supports two obvious policy   recommendations: increasing women‟s access to education and promote their  participation in   decision making  positions , this includes administrative p ositions in education sector.    Qualitative methods were used to collect and analyze data from 70 participants who were   selected purposively and randomly . This included, the district education board secretary, 2   Senior Education Standard Off icers ( ESO) , 2 top management officials from HR department, 20   school administrators, 5 PTA chairpersons , and  40 Teachers (20 males and 20 females)   respectively . Data from one to one  semi -structured interviews  and questionnaire s were   thematically analysed. Presentatio ns of the findings were done using tables , direct quotations and    simple narrations.    However, t he findings of the study revealed  that the  current situation of gender gaps  in   administrative  positions in both rural and urban schools was as a result of  male  domina nce in   administrative positions and qualities  for school administrators. Motivation was found to be a   leading factor in the current changes in gender gaps in school administrative positions.

This research study had three objectives. The first one was to a ssess   how well the revised curriculum was performing in the provision of quality education. The second   objective was to identify the relationship between the revised curriculum and provision of quality   education and the third was to evaluate the revised cu rriculum impact on the provision of quality   education.    A descriptive research design was used in this study and data was analyzed using both quantitative   and qualitative approaches. In this study, the sixty - seven (67) sample size for this study comprised    02 ESOs from the District Education Board Office, 05)head teachers, 05 Deputy Head teachers,   10 senior teachers and 45 teachers from 05 government primary schools in Kazungula district. 45   Teachers were sampled using stratified random sampling. Simple ran dom sampling was used to   select 6 pupils and 20 teachers while purposeful sampling was used to select 4 school   administrators.    The major findings of the study were lack of quantity and quality of teaching staff to meet the   expectations of the pupils and th e society, and poor condition of service for curriculum   implementation. There was also shortage of teaching learning materials, 57.9% indicated that the   revised curriculum had impact on the provision of quality education in primary schools; it has   helped l earners to obtain computer literacy at an early age, it has compelled some teachers to   acquire computer literacy in order to cope with the new curriculum requirements.    Based on the findings of the study, four recommendations were given. There was need to c ontinue   the construction of more primary schools especially in rural areas and this could be accompanied   by the construction of more classrooms so as to address the problem of teacher pupil ratio. There   was need to provide quality teaching and learning mat erials. These could be enough so as to   address the problem of book pupil ratio. More teachers could also be trained in handling   technological subjects. There is also need to reorient teachers on how to deliver the content of the   revised curriculum in the c lassroom.

During the years of maize failure due to drought, there is need for other crops to   enhance food security like Orange Fleshed Sweet Potato. Since the 2010/2011 farming season, the   Orange Fleshed Sweet Potato has been integrated in the farming syste m of the smallholder farmers   of Eastern Province to help the household food security.    The aim of this study was on the diffusion of the Orange Fleshed Sweet Potato and its contribution   to the household food security and livelihoods of the smallholder farme rs in Petauke District of   Eastern Province in Zambia. The specific objectives were: i, To establish the diffusion of the   OFSP;ii, To assess the contributions of the OFSP to household food security in ; iii, To find out the   livelihoods improvement for smallh older farmer households and iv, To identify the challenges   smallholder farmers face in the growing of the OFSP . A questionnaire was used to collect data from   a purposively selected sample of 118Orange Fleshed Smallholder farmers. Key informants and two   Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were used to triangulate data from the questionnaire. The analysis   of quantitative data was done by the aid of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 20).   This helped to come up with percentages presented in statistic al tables and graphs.    The innovation was introduced in Petauke in 2010/2011 farming season by the International Potato   Centre. In 2011/2012; 76.3% smallholder farmers adopted the crop while in 2012/2013; 6.7%   additional smallholder farmers adopted and in the 2013/2014; 16.9% respondents adopted.  The   diffusion of the Orange Fleshed Sweet Potatoes was through hierarchical diffusion which was   expansion in nature. The pillars of food security met were food availability and access.    The crop contributed to the household food security because the adopters had additional food from   the OFSP. The livelihoods of the people improved because they were able to raise money to by   household goods and managed to buy family goods and services. The challenges the farmers face d   were the acquisition of vines for planting, diseases, pests and difficulties in preservation. The other   challenge was lack or insufficient different types of capitals like physical, financial, and social. A   lot of opportunities exist for the OFSP because  the crop was viable as it contributed to their   livelihood that they could buy farming implements and inputs for other crops like maize from the   money earned after selling the harvest.

repetitive and stereotyped   patterns of behavior. It is considered to be a severe disability because of its persistent lifelong   effects on the affected individ ual and his or her family.  A number of researches report that   parents of children with ASD show higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression than those   of normally developing children. Therefore, families’ coping mechanisms need to be   explored so that health care workers can tap from them in order to help other parents.    Nevertheless there is very little understanding of how families adapt and support each other   in such situations.    The general objective of this study was to explore adaptation patterns of  family members   caring for a child with ASD at UTH and Bauleni Special schools  in Lusaka  according to   Virginia Henderson’s Activities of Daily Living  (ADL) .   Qualitative methodology utilising an interpretive phenomenological approach was used on a   sample of eighteen family members who were selected using purposive sampling. Data were   collected through individual in -depth interviews and a single focus group discussion (FGD).   van Manen’s six steps of analysis were  used to analyse data.    Three major themes , namel y: Perceived sources of parental distress; Experiences and beliefs;   and A ccommodating the needs of a child with ASD, emerged from the data. The major   themes were supported by several subthemes.  The implications of the findings on practice are   that most parents were greatly distressed by their children’s behavioural disorders and made   significant adaptation changes in order to cope with the situation.  Delays in diagnosis   occurred due to lack of knowledge of ASD amongst health care workers and negative cultur al   beliefs resulting into  late school placement.  It was also noted that the ability for families to   accommodate their child with ASD affected their adaptation.    It is therefore recommended that health workers utilise successful adaptation patterns to help   parents and families with a child with ASD.

Despite the increasing interest and funding in CA, its disadoption among smallholder   farmers is common especially after the end of CA projects. Several studies have been   undertaken on the adoption of CA but few studies have been conducted on the factor s that   lead to disadoption of CA. Thus, this study identifies factors that contribute to disadoption of   CA and opportunities for reducing disadoption among smallholder farmers in Petauke District   of Zambia.       The data was collected from 92 randomly selecte d smallholder farming households using   questionnaires; in -depth interviews with seven purposively selected key informants and four   focus group discussions. Qualitative data was analyzed by thematic and content analysis and   quantitative data was analyzed by  chi-square and a binary regression. Results show that 29   percent of smallholder farmers disadopted CA. CA basins were the most disadopted due to   their labour intensiveness. The four most commonly cited factors leading to disadoption of   CA as reported by smallholder farmers are lack of farm transport for manure (31 percent),   high labour demand (25 percent), lack of adequate knowledge in CA (16 percent), a nd lack of   free incentives (16 percent). Chi -square analysis showed significant association between each   of the following factors with disadoption of CA: labour intensity; lack of access to free   incentives; lack of farm transport for manure and poor local CA leadership. Regression results   showed that lack of transport for manure; lack of adequate knowledge in CA; location and   lack of free incentives (material items given) contributed significantly towards increased   likelihood of CA disadoption at 0.05 level  of significance. From the smallholder farmers‟   perception s, options for reducing the disadoption of CA were increased access to free   incentives including herbicides; enhance CA training; increase access to transportation of   manure; provision of CA equipme nt and good local CA leadership.       Thus this study concludes that most of the factors that influence disadoption involve the   attitude  of the farmers, dependency on incentives, labour constraints, poor rapport between the   local CA leadership and smallholder farmers, and lack of essential CA assets. This study   recommends that CA promoters, donors and government should help smallholder farmers to   become self -reliant, reduce their provision of free agricultural inputs and enhance CA   trainings to smallholder farm ers so as to minimize disadoption of the technology.

Despite the increasing interest and funding in CA, its disadoption among smallholder   farmers is common especially after the end of CA projects. Several studies have been   undertaken on the adoption of CA but few studies have been conducted on the factor s that   lead to disadoption of CA. Thus, this study identifies factors that contribute to disadoption of   CA and opportunities for reducing disadoption among smallholder farmers in Petauke District   of Zambia.       The data was collected from 92 randomly selecte d smallholder farming households using   questionnaires; in -depth interviews with seven purposively selected key informants and four   focus group discussions. Qualitative data was analyzed by thematic and content analysis and   quantitative data was analyzed by  chi-square and a binary regression. Results show that 29   percent of smallholder farmers disadopted CA. CA basins were the most disadopted due to   their labour intensiveness. The four most commonly cited factors leading to disadoption of   CA as reported by smallholder farmers are lack of farm transport for manure (31 percent),   high labour demand (25 percent), lack of adequate knowledge in CA (16 percent), a nd lack of   free incentives (16 percent). Chi -square analysis showed significant association between each   of the following factors with disadoption of CA: labour intensity; lack of access to free   incentives; lack of farm transport for manure and poor local CA leadership. Regression results   showed that lack of transport for manure; lack of adequate knowledge in CA; location and   lack of free incentives (material items given) contributed significantly towards increased   likelihood of CA disadoption at 0.05 level  of significance. From the smallholder farmers‟   perception s, options for reducing the disadoption of CA were increased access to free   incentives including herbicides; enhance CA training; increase access to transportation of   manure; provision of CA equipme nt and good local CA leadership.       Thus this study concludes that most of the factors that influence disadoption involve the   attitude  of the farmers, dependency on incentives, labour constraints, poor rapport between the   local CA leadership and smallholder farmers, and lack of essential CA assets. This study   recommends that CA promoters, donors and government should help smallholder farmers to   become self -reliant, reduce their provision of free agricultural inputs and enhance CA   trainings to smallholder farm ers so as to minimize disadoption of the technology.

While most company registers have concentrated on simplifying business registrations, reducing the number of procedures, time and cost for small entities to be formed, compliance remains a big challenge for many Company Registers. Compliance is not just influenced by economic variables of enforcement and penalties but should be understood in the context of behaviour as influenced by demographic, socio-economic and Institutional factors. The aim of this study was to identify and explain the factors influencing compliance behaviour in filing company annual returns based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour in Zambia. The study used a mixed research approach. A sample of 165 registered companies was randomly selected from the population of 68,049 active companies on the PACRA register. Nine PACRA officers were selected using judgment sampling and in-depth interviews were used.  Primary data were collected through structured questionnaires. The secondary data were also collected by reviewing related published and unpublished materials.  Statistical tests of independence (chi-square tests) formed the basis of analysis.  The results of this study showed that annual return filings are influenced both by demographic and external factors. The demographic factors like employment status, Age and education were found to positively influence compliance. Further, compliance was highest (68%) among those with tertiary education compared with (47%) among those with no form of schooling. The study also revealed that those in formal employment were more compliant (64%) than those without employment (47%).  Gender was found to be an insignificant factor and such it has no influence on compliance. On external factors, cultural norms, government policies and compliance fees were identified in the study and were found to have an influence on compliance (save for compliance fees). Finally, the findings of the study may guide government institutions that spend huge costs on enforcement year in year out but it is not so effective and that low penalty fees do not all the time cause voluntary compliance. Further, before Institutions implement costly sensitization campaigns and educational clinics, they need to understand variables that cause compliance behaviour. The study findings can help Policy makers and PACRA meeting its strategic goals of raising compliance levels which currently stand at 40% to about 70%.

The incidence of   TB has risen in recent years, partly as a result of the impact of the HIV and AIDS   epidemic. Therefore, Diagnostic Counselling and Testing (DCT) was  recommended as part of the   treatment package of tuberculosis patient.This will help improve the patient‟s quality of life,   delaying and preventing complications and deaths due to opportunistic infections that could arise   from late detection of HIV/AIDS.Di agnostic Counselling and Testing can best be achieved by   information, communication and education to  patients with Tuberculosis( TB) on the importance   of testing early.  The objective of the study was to examine the utilization of DCT and associated   factors among patients with TB at Monze Mission Hospital in Southern province of Zambia.    Methods: An institutional -based cross -sectional study was conducted at Monze Mission Hospital   chest clinic. Simple random sampling method was used to select in/out patients wi th tuberculosis   from within the hospital.Data was collected from patients who consented for enrolment from   October to December 2014.  A semi-structured interview schedule was used to collect data. The   relationships between the different categories of variab les were investigated using Pearson‟s Chi   squar ed test for association and further fitting logistic regression model. The independent   variables were determined to be significantly associated with the outcome variables after   bivariate Chi -square testing wer e included into the logistic regression model.  Binary logistic   regression analysis of data was carried out using IBM® SPSS®Statistics for Windows version   20.0 to predict factors influencing DCT.    Results: A total of 226 patients were sampled and out of which, 150  (66.7%) did not utilize DCT   and 76 (33.3%) utilized DCT . Diagnostic Testing and Counselling was a associated with the level   of knowledge and confidentiality.  The p value of level of knowledge and confidentiality were   less than 0.05 and therefore failed to reject the null hypothesis. Multivariate binary logistic   regression model predicted that confidentiality and knowledge were associated with DCT at p   value < 0.05        ', '123456789_6334_1.txt': '5    ACKNOWLEDGEMENT    .

Most developing countries in Africa are at the eme rging stage   of e-government development and lag far behind developed nations despite having had national e -  government strategies in place for a considerable period of time.  The harsh socio -economic and   infrastructural context makes the sustainability of a n Information System (IS) a major issue.   Technology transfer to Africa has been too dependent on external factors, like international donor   aid, and emphasized on technology itself.    Despite government and public sector entities allocating huge sums on the ir budgets into   Information Systems implementations with an objective to ameliorate service delivery, promote   accountability and transparency and improve overall operations, benefit and value realization from   these investments are hardly achieved . There is  a need for locally developed, appropriate   information systems, which are based on local needs and structures. This research argues that the   Information systems acquisition, development and implementations should be done using   appropriate methods in a Zamb ian (African) context based on local needs and structures. The   research has been done by surveying 5 public interest user companies in Zambia, literature review   in information systems acquisition, development and implementations in South Africa, Kenya,   Nigeria, India and in the context of developing and developed countries.    The Information systems acquisition, development and implementations in Zambia is ambitious,   and capable of providing solutions for local companies, but the resources for investments are   scarce. In Zambia, low I.T Infrastructure, People, Technology and poor implementation approach   are some of the identified hindrances to the growth of the sector.

Lusaka incorporated play parks in   its city’s plan based on Ebenezer Howard’s ‘Garden City’ Concept as a way of beautifying   the city and benefit ing from a number of attributes relating to people’s mental health , social,   environmental, physical and economic life. Despite these immense benefits, it is not clear    how people use play parks in Lusaka C ity. T hus, this  study  sought to find out how people in    Lusaka City utilise play parks and establish the factors which influence their use.  The study   further examined the extent to which people used play parks in the city and whether there   were differences  in this use across different segments of the urban population , seeing that   there is no policy  guiding play park services  in Zambia.  The three play parks  which were   selected for this study were  Joy Park and Gardens , located  in Matero, Libala Play Park in   Libala Stage II and Havillah Play Park and Gard ens in Rhodes Park. A case s tudy approach   was followed , using both qualitative and quantit ative data collection methods. Semi -  structured i ntervie ws were conducted with ten key informants who were purposively   sampled , while a questionnaire survey was used to collect data from f orty-five play park   visitors who were  conveniently sampled . Qualitative data w as analysed using thematic  and   content analysis , whereas quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics. The study   findings indicate that play parks in Lusaka City are used for social, spiritual, economical ,   physical activity  and bio -diversity  reasons . The study findings show  that people’s use of play   parks is mainly determined by the quality of a play park  (44.1%) , availabil ity of facilities   (10.1%), accessibility  (7.3%) and safety of a play park  (11%). O thers (27.5%) visit play parks   because of the natural and undisturbed environment found at the play park which offers them   escape (refug ee) from fast paced urban life and an opportunity to reflect. The main users of   play parks are f amilies, school -going children and college students, work groups and   religious groups. These groups of people utilis e play parks based on their levels of education,   occupation and income stat us. The study findings show that people from Medium Density   Areas use play parks the most and the majority  of play park visitors are in formal   employment. Further,  most play park visitors have either secondary education (51.1%) or   tertiary education (35.1% ). Lusaka City Council (LCC)  has leased all its play p arks to the    private sector , but t he lack of policy on the use of play parks has adversely affected the   efficiency  and effective ness in running  these play parks. The study recommends the   formulation of p olicy to clearly set out rules and expectations for the delivery of play park   services to the public.

', '123456789_6353_1.txt': 'v    ABSTRACT       Narratologists concede  that every narrative  has an agency who conveys the story. This is   the speaker that recounts events  as one listens to the story. Voice is an integral aspect in   narrative analysis. The study  aimed at analysing the similarities and differences in the use   of narrative voice in  the novels  Stillborn  and Allah Is Not Obliged . These were evaluated   in order to establish their significance to the narrative system of the two texts. The   qualitative approach was utilised and the study was a desk research . The p rimary texts   were purposefully sampled as they are both historical fiction al works  told by narrators   who po rtray how political turmoil such as  war in their respective societies wounds their   psych e. A close comparative reading of the two text was conducted. Secondary data from   articles, journals, books and electronic sources were examined mainly using the theory  of   narratology buttressed by the psychoanalytical literary theory. Findings were that in both   texts, the narration is done retrospectively by several homodiegetic voices but Seun, a   peripheral character is more audible in Stillborn  whereas Allah Is Not Ob liged  is   dominantly told by an autodiegetic narrator Birahima.  Retrospective narrations  are   important as they  enable the narrators to reflect on past events and  examine  their inner   thoughts before narrating . Homodiegetic narra tors are believable since  they recount what   they witness to a certain degree.  The peripheral homodiegetic  narrator  exhibits sympathy   towards the protagonists while the autodiegetic narrator recounts with depth as a victim    of war , revealing his damaged psyche  more than the observing narrator . Narrative   embedding though more extensive in Stillborn  is a vital artistic strategy used to develop   themes, characterisation, create diversity, suspense and harmony in both texts. The   functions of the narrator according to Genette’s  (1980)  model are all carried out by the   overarching narrators. It is mainly through Seun’s and Birahima’s  perspect ive that the   tales are narrated . In directing the story, Birahima often pauses the story and time while   Seun recounts continually.  This demonstrates how va ryingly narrators can manipulate the   narrative’s flow. Through the communicative function , they  confess their repressed   emotional wounds and desires  to the narratee . Their childhood experiences play a pivotal   role in shaping the narratives.  They also attest to what they recount but Birahima   authenticates his account further by swearing. Testify ing render s the narrators believable   to the narratee.  Political  mayhems,  ethnic and religious conflict  are condemned through   ideas the narrators commu nicate . This is essential to the development of themes.  That   both narrators are also  narratees contributes to the construction of the matrix  narratives   since they graft the received tales to them .   Key words: Narratology, narrative voice, significance, homo diegetic .    ', '123456789_6355_1.txt': 'vi    ACKNOWLEGEMENT    God, the author and the one that sustains my life.

The study focused on TaxOnline  system   used by domestic taxes division in Zambia. The study was conducted in Solwezi town of   Zambia. In this study, the researcher used Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The   sample size was purposively selected from various taxpayers who were coming thro ugh to   Zambia Revenue Authority Solwezi internet bureau. 100 semi structured survey   questionnaires were distributed with 100% response. The data collected was analyzed using   descriptive statistics.  The Pearson correlation coefficient and P -values were used  to determine   the relationship between variables.  The results showed that, E -tax system in Zambia is useful,   easy to use and also secure . Based on the findings, majority of the taxpayers are filing their   returns and paying taxes online. However, there are few taxpayers who still feel E -tax is not   useful, easy to use and secure. Therefore, more awareness and taxpayer education must   continue to bring everyone on board. E -Tax involves E -Filing and E -Payment which is the   process of submitting returns over the i nternet using an approved E -Tax system. Adoption is   the action or fact of choosing to take up or follow something. Technology Acceptance Model   is an information system theory that models how users come to accept and use a technology.   TaxOnline is a system used in Zambia to file returns and pay taxes online.

Reducin g the physical pain and anxiety during  MVA is the ultimate goal of   management  for which, several drugs have been  used solely or in combination to try to   alleviate the pain associated with the procedure with variable results. However, the a spect of   anxiety, which is a crucial aspect of care, is not adequately taken care of and perhaps raises   ethical issues around performing MVA under local anaesthesia in emotionally vulnerable   miscarrying women.       A previous  study done at University Teaching H ospital (UTH), Lusaka, Zambia showed that   more than 90% of wome n undergoing MVA experience severe pain, despite receiving   preoperative analgesics such as Paracetamol,  Ibuprofen and Morphine . Ketofol  sedation has   not been tried in MVA in our setting  in spite of successfully producing  adequate sedation   action for many short painful  procedures .   A pre -post interventional study with historical controls was conducted as a quality   improvement study at UTH in the Departme nt of Gynaecology to explore the potential of    Ketofol sedation  to provide adequate sedation and analgesia in women undergoing MVA.    Pain scores were recorded using a Faces Pain Scale during the procedure (reported   immediately after the procedure), at 10 min utes and at 60 minutes. During the procedure,   sedation scor es were determined using Ramsay Sedati on Scale as well measuring heart rate s   and oxygen saturation. Time to discharge was  also measured.        A total of 94 women were studied; 54 patients who received UTH standard care in the   previous study (oral Paracetamol 1g, Ibuprofen 400mg and Morphine 30mg) and 40 patients   who received Ketofol  sedation in addition to the UTH standard care which the patients in the   historical group also received.  Data from 2015 inc luded 54 (57.4%) women who received   UTH standard care (oral Paracetamol, Ibuprofen and Morphine). In the current study Ketofol    sedation was administered in addition to standard care to 40 women during MVA. There was   no statistical difference in all baselin e characteristics of participants in both groups; p value   >0.05. Pain scores were measured during the procedure (reported immediately afterwards),   at 10 minutes and 60 minutes after the procedure. Women in the standard care group   reported significantly hig her pain scores, median 10 (IQR,8 -10) compared to women in the    Ketofol group median 2 (IQR 0 –2); p<0.001 during the procedure, and also reported more   pain at 10 minutes after the procedure however, there was no statistically significant   difference in pain recorded at 60 minutes after the procedure. It was further noted that   patients in the Ketofol  group had significantly lower heart rates during the  proced ure.   addition t o this, it was noted, contrary to expectations, that the time to discharge was reduced   in the Ketofol  group compared to the standard care group, potentially due to reduced pain   experienced .      In conclusion, the results suggest that addition of Ketofol  sedati on to the current UTH   standard of care reduced procedural pain experienced during MVA compared to standard   care alone as well as produc ing effective sedation and rapid recovery.

The treatment of choice in the first trimester is manual vacuum aspirati on   (MVA). Reducin g the physical pain and anxiety during  MVA is the ultimate goal of   management  for which, several drugs have been  used solely or in combination to try to   alleviate the pain associated with the procedure with variable results. However, the a spect of   anxiety, which is a crucial aspect of care, is not adequately taken care of and perhaps raises   ethical issues around performing MVA under local anaesthesia in emotionally vulnerable   miscarrying women.       A previous  study done at University Teaching H ospital (UTH), Lusaka, Zambia showed that   more than 90% of wome n undergoing MVA experience severe pain, despite receiving   preoperative analgesics such as Paracetamol,  Ibuprofen and Morphine . Ketofol  sedation has   not been tried in MVA in our setting  in spite of successfully producing  adequate sedation   action for many short painful  procedures .   A pre -post interventional study with historical controls was conducted as a quality   improvement study at UTH in the Departme nt of Gynaecology to explore the potential of    Ketofol sedation  to provide adequate sedation and analgesia in women undergoing MVA.    Pain scores were recorded using a Faces Pain Scale during the procedure (reported   immediately after the procedure), at 10 min utes and at 60 minutes. During the procedure,   sedation scor es were determined using Ramsay Sedati on Scale as well measuring heart rate s   and oxygen saturation. Time to discharge was  also measured.        A total of 94 women were studied; 54 patients who received UTH standard care in the   previous study (oral Paracetamol 1g, Ibuprofen 400mg and Morphine 30mg) and 40 patients   who received Ketofol  sedation in addition to the UTH standard care which the patients in the   historical group also received.  Data from 2015 inc luded 54 (57.4%) women who received   UTH standard care (oral Paracetamol, Ibuprofen and Morphine). In the current study Ketofol    sedation was administered in addition to standard care to 40 women during MVA. There was   no statistical difference in all baselin e characteristics of participants in both groups; p value   >0.05. Pain scores were measured during the procedure (reported immediately afterwards),   at 10 minutes and 60 minutes after the procedure. Women in the standard care group   reported significantly hig her pain scores, median 10 (IQR,8 -10) compared to women in the    Ketofol group median 2 (IQR 0 –2); p<0.001 during the procedure, and also reported more   pain at 10 minutes after the procedure however, there was no statistically significant   difference in pain recorded at 60 minutes after the procedure.

The act was aimed at reversing stifled development  across the country   using private financing.    Even with legislation in place, prospective deve lopers often   weigh risks of implementing PPP projects in Africa.  For Zambia, unclear and protracted   negotiation procedures  have tainted the performance of such executed projects .   Consideration of risk allocated to the developer influences decisions made re garding   timely execution of projects. The research aimed to determine critical success factors   and mitigation impacts used in successfully implemented PPP projects. Data gathered on   risk allocation decision -making processes used a mixed research method tha t included   structured interviews, a questionnaire survey and  two case studies . Descriptive analysis,   Rotated Component Matrix and Pearson Correlation Coefficients were used to establish   relationships between independent and dependent variables for allocate d risk.  The   ontological and epistemological philosophical basis of the researcher utilised a   positivistic pragmatic constructionist analytical explanation of the PPP phenomena on   two projects in Zambia. These were University of Zambia East Park Mall develo pment   and the Kasumbalesa Border infrastructure.    The percentage survey response was 46% obtained from 47 analysed questionnaires out   of the 120 that were  administered. Results indicated professionals‟ inability to evaluate   developer‟s risks particularly at  the proposal assessment stage. The PPP contract   outlines risk to the parties involved. Technically, project developers show greater   preparedness during negotiations  in bargaining for their allocated risk . Decisions made,   therefore, were found not to consi st of relevant inputs from areas of risk allocation and   risk mitigation to ensure project success by those evaluating schemes. The research   proposed a  decision -making framework for the timely execution of such  projects in   Zambia. This decision -making frame work would  limit the time of implementing PPP    projects from three to five years to less than  two years and would cover all the phases,   namely; the proposal submission, negotiation, the construction and operation stages.

Globally, there are about 36.6 million people living with HIV infection and   about 70 % (25 million) of these live in sub -Saharan Africa .  HIV burden needs   greater attention  in the planning of EMTCT programmes. This study aimed at   determining the possible risks and the prevalence of HIV seroconversion in pregnant   women of Southern province in Zambia from 2012 to 2016. Also to assess adherence   to the recommended number of HIV tests. It was imperative to undertake this study   as the results would provide important insights to policy makers and for other   important decisions in an effort to reduce HIV seroconversion in pregnant women.    This was a retrospective cohort study design. Data was obtained from the Smart Care   data base in the department of Information Technology at Ministry of Health   Headquarters in Lusaka.  Cross tabulations were used to determine associations and   logistic regression analysis was used to determine the best  predictors at p -value less   than 0.05 and 95% confidence interval. Chi square for trends was used to assess the   trend of HIV seroconversion prevalence.   Complete case analysis was used to take   care of missing data.   Data was missing completely at random an d the missing values   were d istributed across all variables thus this was the suitable method.    From the study population (n=3,489), 242 seroconverted, giving an overall   prevalence of 6.9%.   The p -value (0.035) for trend analysis was statistically   significan t. There was no evidence of association for  marital status and partner HIV   test. Those with primary education had 91% reduced risk (p -value 0.02, CI 0.01 -  0.68) and those with secondary education had 85% reduced risk of seroconverting (p -  value 0.05, CI 0.02 -1.01). These were statistically significant at multivariable   analysis.   148 (6.3%) of those married seroconverted . Majority (86.2%) of the study   participants had two HIV tests.  The trend for HIV seroconversion in pregnant women   of Southern province was do wnwards from 2015 to 2016.   Primary and secondary   education levels were independently significant factors associated with HIV   seroconversion.  Adherence to the recommended number of HIV tests was poor as   majority of participants only had two tests .

This later results in the  deterioration of the urban environment in form of air, water, and   land pollution that poses risks to human health and the environment. In the developing world,   urbanization implies the expansion of existing slum areas and the mushrooming of new ones. The   provision of solid waste management services in Zambia’s Kanyama settlement, a slum area in the   capital city Lusaka has proved to be a challenge which has been worsened and exacerbated by the   lack of community engagement resulting in indiscriminate disposa l of waste on the streets, empty   spaces, ditches, drainages and streams. The purpose of this study is to explore ways to promote   community participation in solid waste management using participatory action research.    The study employed qualitative particip atory action research methods. Data was collected using   Photo Voice as a core method with 3 Focus Group Discussions. A meandering Transect walk was   conducted with 12 participants and 10 Key Informant Interviews. Data was analyzed using   thematic analysis. Q ualitative data analysis for photo voice involved an iterative, multi -stage,   collaborative process between the participants and researcher.     The participatory study revealed that ward ten is grappling with major solid waste challenges, the   community is li ttered with hip and hips of uncollected garbage, clogged drainage and strong stench   coming from the uncollected garbage and over flowing pit latrines and swamps in the   neighborhood.  The study further unearthed illegal solid waste management practices and   behaviors that residents have adopted over the years which has prevented them from subscribing   to waste collection services. Illegal dumpsites have been created by residents in the community    Community led and community participation has long been accepted  as the only sustainable   process of ensuring long lasting and permanent positive change in the urban poor communities.   The study explored community participation the inward ten of Kanyama, the findings point out to   the fact that the lack of community led a pproaches to solid waste management  as well as practices   and attitudes adopted by the community over the years have allowed continued indiscriminate   disposal of waste. As a community action oriented study these findings are not only relevant for   planning,  implementation purposes, the findings also authoritatively point out of the residents ‘s   demands for revision of the legislative and policy environment in solid waste management in the   country .  The study also points the need for vigorous and massive com munity engagement for the   residents   to begin to change their mindset regarding waste in the community. The findings of this   study further emphasize the importance of embracing community friendly and community led   innovative ways of tackling of solid wast e.

Where weighing is not   feasible, age or length based formulae are used  to estimate weight. Formulae must be   validated in the local population as most are derived from high income countries where   childhood obesity is increasing.    The “Lusaka formula” was derived from a previously published data set. The study aimed to   validate  this formula in a new data set. Weights, heights and age of 330 children were   measured before surgery. Accuracy was examined by comparing the (1) Mean Percentage   Error and (2) the percentage of actual weights that fell between 10% and 20% of the   estimated  weight for the Lusaka formula and other existing formulae.    The Lusaka formula had a mean percentage error of 1.37% (95% limits of agreement 7.7, -  6.8) and estimated weights to within 10% of actual weight 48.5% of the time. It had a slight   tendency to under estimate weights. Its precision was comparable to the Broselow tape.    No significant difference was found between the sexes with regards to the mean age,   measured weight and estimated weights differences but  regression analysis showed that   maternal educatio n level significantly predicts weight for children above 1 year. Out of the   163 children aged 0 -5 years, 17.8% had under nutrition of varying extents; 3.1% had extreme   malnutrition, 3.1% had severe malnutrition and 11.7% had moderate malnutrition.    The stud y concluded that when actual weight is unknown, the Lusaka formula is superior to   previously published age based weight estimating formulae in children presenting for surgery   at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) in Lusaka, Zambia.

A mixed methods study design was adopted and 60 traders were enrolled in the study. A short   survey questionnaire and in -depth interviews were used to collect data for this study.   Quantitative data was analysed using SPSS version 16 and qualitative data was  analysed using   content analysis.    It was not expected that the traders would not be aware of any tax. In this sample, all the traders   were not aware of withholding and turnover tax es. They were however aware of Domestic VAT   and Base Tax.  The payment of do mestic tax (n = 35; 58.7%) was higher than that of Base tax (n   = 14; 23.3%. N = 14 (68%) paid Base tax  leaving n = 9 (32%) who were not. Regarding   domestic tax, only n = 2 (8.6%) were not paying this tax as compared to n = 33 (91.4%) who did.   Compliance wa s associated with costs  of punishment. Others paid tax because they saw it as a   moral obligation while others were compelled to pay tax because they had trusted in the   government in terms of its manifesto and the services it was offering. As for evasion, the level of   knowledge p layed a significant role in paying tax among these traders. Some traders opted to pay   some taxes whereas other paid both. They cited unfairness in the prescription of amounts to be   paid as well as persons to pay. They found it justifying to evade paying ta xes or under declare   taxes as they fall due. Others did not see any need to trust the government as services were not   top and there was a lot of corruption.    The study concludes that t he high number of traders and the variability and mobility in their   operations, is likely to make it difficult for even the most capable tax authorities to effectively   administer these taxes. Education campaigns that raise awareness about the benefits that result   from the taxes collected, and about the efforts made by tax auth orities to reduce unfairness (such   as introducing low but graduated tax rates according to turnover for instance), may also improve   tax morale and ultimately revenue collection.

Despite the fo regoing, the use of ICTs in both public and private sector, at individual and   institutional levels, has brought about a spectrum of ethical challenges in our societies  thereby   undermining efforts made to encourage citizens adopt the use of electronic servi ces deployed for   public service . The objectives of this research were to establish what ethical issues arise in e -  government implementation especially in developing countries, in this case Zambia and the   impact these ethical issues have on e -government imp lementation. In addition, to understand   how IT systems can be designed to address the identified ethical issues that arise in e -  government.    From the research, it was established that the prominent ethical issues that arise in e -government   implementation are security and privacy.  44% of the respondents agree, in addition to 28% who   strongly agree, that the inclusion of ethical issues in planning of e -government will contribute to   the successful implementation of e -government.  Only 38.5% of the respondents affirm that the   current e -government policy address es these ethical issues in e -government implementation   while 30.8% disagree and another 30.8% are not sure.    This study recommends  that a holistic approach to the addressing of these ethical issues should   be adopted by governments  to avoid formulation of policies in silos. The design of such policies   must precede any systems design as systems design must manifest efforts to address the ethical   issues that arise in the use of the particular system s concerned  using Value Sensitive Design .

Some of the challe nges been faced    include: households’ low income s, low elect ricity tariffs, dispersed settlements ,   inadequate funding and centralization of electrical materials among others. The study   also finds that rural households seldom  use electricity for domestic bus iness activities.   Generally, the study finds  the contribution of electrification towards improving rural   standard of li ving through improved livelihoods  negligible. In relation  to households’   access to social goods , the study finds the contribution of elec trification towards   improving households’ standard of living through improved access to healthcare, clean   water and sanitation insignificant.  However, the study finds significant positive impact   of electrification towards improving rural standard of livin g through improved access to   information, communication and entertainment, preservation of foodstuffs and   enhanced  access to education and physical  security of households. Based on the   findings, government through Rural Electrification Authority  (REA)  need  to consider   and promote cheaper  and affordable sources of renewable energy such as Photovoltaic   systems for rural areas . Government should also consider reducing connection charges   for rural households and introduce electricity tariffs that reflect socio -economic status of   rural communities . Furthermore, there is need for government to enhance capacity of   local institutions such as District  Councils in rural areas to accelerate electrification     rate. District  Councils must be involved in the provision an d management of electricity   in rural communities.  There is also need to decentralise operations of REA to rural   District s.

Reasons for this disparity are not   fully understood.    This study aimed to investigate the potential association between indic ators of nutritional status   (vitamin A status, weight for age, height for age and mid -upper arm circumference) of the infants   and sero -conversion among Zambian infants routinely immunized with rotavirus vaccine,   Rotarix™.    A total of 1320 infants were asse ssed for enrolment and420 infants were recruited at infant age   6-12 weeks in Lusaka, Zambia. Clinical information and samples were collected at baseline and   at one month following the second dose of rotavirus vaccine. Only 208 infant samples were   analyzed at baseline and one month after vaccination to determine infant nutritional status   (vitamin A status, weight for age, height for age status and mid -upper arm circumference.   Vitamin A status and serum rotavirus -specific IgA were determined using standardize d Enzyme   Linked Immuno -sorbent Assay methods. The anthropometric indices were interpreted using   WHO growth standards. Sero -conversion was defined as a ≥ 4 fold rise in serum IgA titre from   baseline to one -month post Rotarix™ dose 2, while sero -positivity o f IgA was defined as serum   titre ≥ 40. Pearson Chi -squared test was used to investigate the association of sero -conversion   and categorical factors (i.e. sex, vitamin A status, weight for age, height for age, mid -upper arm   circumference at baseline and seru m IgA sero -positivity).    The sero -conversion frequency to rotavirus was 57.2% (119/208) and baseline infant sero -  positivity to rotavirus was 23.1% (48/208). Baseline vitamin A deficiency, underweight and   stunting were 78.9% (164/208), 6.7% (14/208) and 52. 4% (109/208), respectively. Base -line    Infant moderate acute malnutrition was 38.0% (79/208 208) and severe acute malnutrition was   12.50% (26/208) as determined by the infant mid -upper arm circumference. There was no   evidence of association between infant s erum IgA sero -conversion and nutritional variables;   serum vitamin A deficiency (p=0.882), stunting (p=0.905), underweight (p=0.243), Mid -Uper   arm circumference (p=0.565) and infant baseline serum IgA sero -positivity (p=0.832).    Poor IgA sero -conversion fre quency observed in this cohort was not influenced by nutritional   factors indicated by infant serum vitamin A status, weight for age, height for age and mid -upper   arm circumference. Early infant exposure to rotavirus infection, determined by infant serum Ig A   sero-positivity levels did not influence sero -conversions frequencies in this cohort. These factors   may have other effects later in childhood, as no difference was observed among seroconvertors   and non -seroconvertors to rotavirus vaccination in the 6 -12 weeks age group. Further research is   needed to better understand vaccine sero -conversion.

O ne of the ir most common   complications  before surgery is incarceration, a life threatening condition with potential to   cause severe short term and long term morbidities like bowel ischaemia, testicular atrophy and   its resultant infertility, in futu re. There appears to be, institutional variability in the rates and   risks of inguinal hernia incarceration among infants and children. This study was conducted   with a purpose to determine our own institutional risk of inguinal hernia incarceration among   infants and children awaiting elective surgery. A retrospective review of infants and children   under the age of 17 years, who had undergone inguinal hernia repair or had incarcerated, from   January 2015 to January  2017 was performed. Interviewer completed questionnaires were used   to abstract data from the clinical records. Three hundred and sixty -four patients were included   for analysis, in this study. Descriptive statistics, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Regres sion   Analysis and Kaplan Meiers Survival Analysis were used . The infants and children were   stratified into seven age groups. The incarceration rates and risks were evaluated for each   group. The overall incarcer ation rate was 13.45% . The risk of incarcerati on was age dependent.   It ranged from 0.52 daily risk of incarceration, among neonates, to zero daily risk of   incarceration among older children. Neonates were as high as five times more likely to   incarcerate as  older infants and children. Likewise, younger  children had higher risk of inguinal   hernia incarceration than older ones. Longer wait times were associated with increased rate and   risk of inguinal hernia incarceration. Overall, risk reduction, of inguinal hernia incarceration,   of more than 50% could b e achieved if inguinal hernia repair was done within 14 days of   diagnosis. This study concluded that,  the rate of incarceration was high (13.45%). The risk of   incarceration was age dependent & higher in neonates (0.52), infants & younger children   (0.01). N eonates had as much as 5 times higher risk as other ch ildren . Longer wait times, male   sex, right sided hernias were associa ted with higher rates & risks . Older children had no   incarceration. The best time to operate is before 3 weeks for neonates, before 2  months for   infants & before 4 months for younger children to prevent incarceration .

Zambia is regarded as a   mining country because of the contribution of mining to its exports, domestic markets,   employment, and opportunities for economic growth and diversification.  Zambia produces 5   percent of the world‟s copper production and it has been generally increasing since 2000. The   increased production has led to quick depletion of ore reserves. The depletion of copper ore   reserves would seriously threaten economic growth and stability. The cop per resources available   to existing mines in Zambia are estimated at 2.8 billion tonnes of ore ranging between 0.6 and   4.0 percent copper. In addition, Zambia has potentially recoverable ores estimated at 1.6 billion   tonnes ranging between 0.4 and 0.5% cop per. In Zambia, economically recoverable copper   deposits are those with grades more than 0.5% for surface mining and more than 1.5 percent for   underground mining. In countries like Chile, Australia, and Canada, deposits at 0.4 percent and   1.0 percent are e conomically extracted by surface and underground mining respectively. Because   copper mining industry is an important economic activity for Zambia,  there is need to   investigate possibilities of economically mining marginal copper ore reserves. The purpose of   this research is therefore to investigate, analyse and determine Zambia‟s potential for mining low   grade copper deposits. If economically mineable, the low -grade deposits will increase copper   reserves from 2.8 billion to 4.4 billion tonnes. The addition al resources would prolong mining   for approximately 30 years.       In order to determine techno -economic potential for mining Zambia‟s low grade copper deposits,   the study had to review the existing data on low grade deposit through literature survey. The   mine ral resources classification and codes of reporting systems were evaluated and it was   revealed that Zambia has not developed a code for the reporting of exploration results, mineral   resources and mineral reserves. It is therefore recommended to employ modi fied United Nations   Framework Classification (UNFC) to develop a Zambia‟s code. The study also analysed macro -  environmental factors affecting Zambia‟s potential for mining low grade copper ore deposits.   PESTLE and SWOT analysis were used to evaluate the ex ternal and internal macro   environmental factors. A more accurate multi -criteria decision making model for PESTLE   analysis was developed and applied. The results indicate that the level of the macro environment   is moderately favorable to mining of low grade  copper ore deposits at the current situation. If   Zambia has to attract credible investors in the mining sector, the country has to improve its   macro -environment level. This can be achieved by addressing the country‟s weaknesses   identified in the SWOT anal ysis.       Kakosa South low grade copper ore deposit was selected as a case study. Kakosa is located about   450km northwest of Lusaka, the capital city of Zambia. In Kakosa area, the footwall aquifer   rocks comprising sandstone and conglomerates are thin and as  such are not expected to represent ', '123456789_6853_1.txt': '    vi DEDICATIONS       I dedicate this work to my parents, Mr Mashikinyi Bestone Muketekelwa and Mrs   Josephine Mwansakombe  for their excellent parental guidance throughout my life.

HIV-positive   women may have fertility desires and may intend to have children but these vary by socio -economic,   socio -cultural and demographic characteristics.  Studies of fertility intentions among HIV -positiv e   individuals report a strong desire to have children. With the advent of Antiretroviral Therapy [ART ], the   quality of life for people living with HIV has also been improved potentially impacting fertility intentions   among HIV -infected individuals . However , little is known about their fertility intentions. Thus, this  study   examine s the fertility intentions  and contraceptive use  among HIV -positive women (15 -49 years) in   Zambia.     The analyses are based on women with linkable information on HIV testing, fertil ity preferences and   contraceptive use from the nationally representative 2013 -14 Zambia and Demographic Health Survey    data. HIV data was merged with each woman’s individual file which also contained household variables   to create an analytical file . Analyse s were carried out after merging the HIV test results and women’s file .    Cross -tabulations with Chi -square tests were conducted to ascertain the crude relationship and finally   multiple logistic regressions were employed to identify the major independent pr edictors of fertility   intention using STATA 14.0 with 5% level of significance.    Findings reveal that  out of the total number of women (9,688)  with linkable information on HIV testing   and fertility preferences, 1,654 (17.1%) were HIV -positive. Among the HIV -positive women, a   considerable proportion (46%) still has intentions for having  children in future.  However, the study   findings indicate a  14% significant difference in fertility intention s between HIV -negative (60%) and   HIV-positive (46%)  women . This stu dy has  also found  that majority (58%) of the HIV -positive women   are not contraceptive users . Multivariate analyses reveal ed that HIV -positive  women have lower odds of   wanting more children when compared to their HIV -negative counterparts .    The study has  concluded that  predictors of fertility intentions and use of contraceptive among women are   different by HIV status.  From the findings,  age, education level, marital status and parity were found to be    the major predictors of fertility intentions among HIV -positive women while among the HIV -negatives ;   age, education level, parity, marital status,  employment status, wealth quintile  and region explained their   fertility intentions . Predictors of contraceptive use among  HIV-positive  women include; marital status,   parity, ethnicity, fertility intention, education level and age. The fact that many HIV -infected women   expect to have children has important implications for the prevention of vertical and horizontal   transmission of HIV. There is therefore , the need for comprehensive and continuous expansion of family   planning, voluntary counseling and prevention of mother -to-child transmission (PMTCT) and integration   of HIV treatment care among HIV -positive mothers to meet diverse reproductive intentions.

In this respect MoE should involve   closely with the Ministry of Health. This is because teachers deal with children living wi th HIV   (CLHIV) on a daily basis in their classrooms, and health workers deal with PLHIV in the   community at large.    \\uf0b7 Teach appropriate Behavior Change Communication (BCC), including sound values, morals, and   principles, and encourage children and parents to  interact with each other, especially teaching   parents to find time to be with and talk to their children about sexuality and HIV.     These responses from several participants demonstrated that there were many gaps in what is   supposed to be taught in primary  schools. These findings therefore show that there is a need for a   comprehensive HIV integrated curriculum that goes beyond theory toward one that is implemented as   part of all teacher training programs for PITs. In order to accomplish this it will be impo rtant to   continue to receive government support from the MoE at the national, provincial, and district levels as   well as from key stakeholders at all levels of the teacher training process.  The support must be   towards comprehensive curriculum development and training the trainers of trainers.    3.3. Effective implementation of an HIV integrated curriculum approach in real teaching   settings.    Because there was such variance in what was being taught about HIV education at the participating   teacher training institutions, it was difficult to fully answer this question. However, some general   findings include :    \\uf0b7 Most HIV education courses offered at the participating TTIs were electives and not required for   pre-service and/or in -service teachers.    \\uf0b7 For pre -service  and in -service teachers who elected to enroll and take HIV education courses   offered as part of their teaching degree/ certificate programs, they were able to receive quality   instruction and examples on how to integrate HIV into their respective disciplin e areas.    \\uf0b7 Teacher trainers are limited in what they can require to be taught on HIV in their respective   subject areas, especially if the topics are not on the formal, examinable part of the curriculum.    \\uf0b7 Teachers in Zambian primary schools are often limited  in what HIV instruction they can offer,   largely because of a lack of sufficient text book examples. More should be done to help provide   integrated examples of HIV in core (if not all) subject areas.     3.4. What role does counseling about HIV and AIDS play in th e early grade levels of primary   education?    Most respondents felt that primary schools should employ and train Guidance and Counselling (G&C)   Teachers. Most administrator (55.3%), teacher trainer (60.0%), pre -service teacher (73.6%), and in -  service teacher (87.5%) respondents felt that teachers should have a certificate in HIV prevention and   counseling to help their students better understand about HIV and to help them make good decisions   related to the disease. But responses on how to certify teachers varie d substantially by respondent   groups, and included anything from a one -day or perhaps a one -week training program to one that is   more comprehensive and is a stand -alone and required course -based (examinable) program of pre -   and in -service teacher training programs.    Counseling plays a crucial role in the instruction of learners at all levels, including in the early -grade   levels. The majority of CAE respondents felt that learners needed to be taught and counseled about   HIV and AIDS as early as possible, and most definitely not to wait until when they reach puberty.   Many CAEs cautioned that the HIV and sexuality instruction should be age -specific, but that HIV   education should begin as early as Grades 1 -4.    The knowledge students acquire must be gradual but in cremental. Some suggested in terms of grades   as starting from pre -school to Grade 3. Others added that children could be taught different messages ', '123456789_6901_1.txt': 'v    DEDICATION       I dedicate this work to the Ndume’s family, especially Kambole Grace and   Shambaka Mumba  for all the support they rendered to me during my stay at the   University of Zambia.

A good example is the 2019 Kulamba   traditional ceremony where the chiefdom partnered with different NGOs in helping improve the girl   child education. These girls are the future development actors o f the chiefdom. Kalonga Gawa Undi   has observed that promoting child education and ending early marriages in his vast kingdom is such   an involving task. For this reason, he has allowed various Non -Governmental Organisation (NGOs)   operate in the kingdom to p romote child education and end early marriage. Among these NGOs are   SAWA, Paralegal, Network for People living with HI V/AIDS (NPLHA), KWATU, PLAN   International, YES I DO, Neighbourhood and Safe -motherhood.    These NGOs have different agendas in the kingdom.  For example, Paralegal ha veformed groups from   the villages that conduct meetings with community members on the danger of early marriages and   teenage pregnancies. They also talk about the advantages of educating a girl child as well as child   education in g eneral. They also have meetings with teenage boys and girls where they explain issues   of abstinence, working hard at school, use of condoms and distribute condoms where possible. It must   be mentioned that these organizations work with the help of subordina te chiefs and village headmen   who coordinate meetings with community members. Organization such a Paralegal and Plan   International have gone further in distributing bicycles to facilitators of such programmes in the   community. USAID is also using education  development assistance and PEPFAR funding to assist the   Ministry of Education with strengthening educational support for vulnerable students in its   community schools. They have also put up posters that promote sending boys and girls to school and   ending e arly marriages. These partnerships contribute to the development of the kingdom.      2.9. Potential Challenges    Traditional ceremonies, if not well handled, may create room for promotion of ethnicity and tribalism.   Much as traditional ceremonies promote cohesiveness especially among members of a particular   ethnic group or tribe, excessive emphasis should not be on p romotion of that group‟s culture as   superiority to other local cultures as doing so may lead to ethic and tribal conflict. Emphasis should be   on promotion of uniqueness of that group‟s cultural activities and what others may learn from them.    Traditional c eremonies risk turning into political battlefield if organisers of such events do not treat   them as apolitical ceremonies. Traditional ceremonies have the potential to create a battleground for   infidelity, promiscuity and for many other risk behaviours tha t support the spread of Sexuality   Transmitted Infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS. They create a market for sex tourists and sex workers.    Since traditional ceremonies have the muscle attract people from all corners of the nation, region and   world, they also po tential refugee camps for externals. These events may open the area to aliens who   may come with ill intentions of thieving, human trafficking and other dangerous acts which could   have been not common in the area.    Much as partnerships with state and non-state are good for local development, organisers of the events   must be worry of the danger of turning a ceremony into a launch for the programmes and services of   partners  (United Nations, 2010) . Excessive use of commercial adverts at the main arena and  branded   outfits by locals risk defeats the purpose of a traditional ceremony which should be dominated by   traditional paintings, dressings and artistic decorations.    3. CONCLUSION     In this regard, there is great need for political decision -makers and local, national and international   social actors to integrate the principles of traditional ceremonies and the values of cultural pluralism   into all public policies, mechanisms and practices, particularly through public/private partnerships.   This strategy aims, on  the one hand, at incorporating culture into all development policies, be they   related to education, science, communication, health, environment or cultural tourism. On the other   hand, it aims at supporting the development of the cultural sector through cr eative industries. By   contributing in this way to poverty alleviation, culture offers important benefits in terms of social   cohesion.    RECOMMENDATIONS    It is therefore recommended that for traditional ceremonies to contribute to socio – economic   development , there is need to take into consideration the following:  ', '123456789_6908_1.txt': 'x      Dedication    This dissertation is dedicated to my father, Snr Chief Inyambo Yeta who first taught me   the value of education and critical thought.

Thus, conservation tillage, along with complementary practices such as  soil cover   and crop diversity has become a better option to ensure sustainable food production   and maintenance of environmental sustainability. A field study was conducted to   evaluate the effect of dry wheat straw mulching and cowpea -maize intercropping   practices on soil erosion and maiz e yield . The field experiment  was conducted  at the   University of Zambia, Great East Road Campus Field Station, in Lusaka, which is   managed  by the School of Agricultural Sciences . The study aimed at assessing the   effect of mulching and intercropping practic es on soil  erosion  and runoff, water   balance and components of the Universal Soil Loss Equation. The study was carried   out in the 2016/2017 rainy season with maize as a test crop. A randomized complete   block design was adopted with three  replicates. Treatments were (i) dry wheat   mulching , (ii) cowpea -maize intercropping and (iii) conventional practices.  The   results showed that the use of dry wheat straw mulch at the rate of 12 ton/ ha could   reduce the amount of soil lost by 14  % as compar ed to the intercropping practice.   The runoff was not significantly affected by the dry wheat mulch and cowpea -maize   intercrop . The annual soil loss predicted from the Universal soil loss equation was   significantly reduced by 58  % in the dry wheat mulch and  29 % in the cowpea -  maize intercrop as compared  to the conventional practice . The non -significance of   the maize yield obtained would have been due to the infestation of Army worms    during the maize tasselling  stage.

Anaesthesia is internationally recognised as one of the most inherently stressful medical   disciplines and this is often compounded by unique challenges within the anaest hetic care   provider’s working environment. It is important , therefore, to assess the extent to which   burnout affects Zambian anaesthetic care providers  as patient safety, the physical and m ental   health of the anaesthetic care provider  and the efficient ins titutional running are all risked in   the presence of burnout.    The study therefore aimed to determine the prevalence of burnout syndrome among anaesthetic   care providers working in Zambian hospitals and to determine which sociodemographic and   occupational f actors were more predictive of burnout.     A cross sectional study among 160 anaesthetic care providers (out of an estimated total of 184)   working in various public and private hospitals in Zambia was performed using the Maslach   Burnout Inventory -human servi ces survey , a validated tool, which is widely used  to assess the   presence of burnout  among health professionals . Sociodemographic and occupational factors   postulated to be associated with burnout were also assessed using a separate structured   questionnaire.    Burnout syndrome was detected in 51% of the 160 respondents, of these 86% were non -  physician anaesthetists  working in diff erent hospitals in the country.  Logistic regression   analysis revealed that “not having the right team to carry out work  to an appropriate standard”   (odds ratio 2.91 95% C.I. 1.33 -6.39, p=0.008), and being non -physician (odds ratio 3.4, 95%   C.I. 1.25 -12.34, p=0.019) were the strongest predictors of burnout in this population.     Burnout levels among Zambian anaesthetic care p roviders are high. The study findings suggest   that i ncreasing the numbers of providers in general may reinforce the hospital anaesthetic team   structure thereby reducing isolation. Furthermore, investing in training more physician   anaesthetists may be prote ctive.

Unsafe drinking water is responsible for transmission of diseases such as Cholera,   Dysentery and Typhoid.  Packaged water can be considered as an alternative to other water   sources  if measures are put in place to ensure its safety for human consumption.  Studies prior to   this one focused on the quality of water sold in Lusaka regardless of the district the water is   produced from.  There has also been less focus on the quality contro l measures that may   influence quality.    A cross -sectional study was conducted to assess the bacteriological and chemical quality of   packaged water produced in Lusaka and associated quality control m easures.   Water samples   from 17  companies producing packa ged water in Lusaka were analyzed for total and feacal   coliforms as well as concentrations for Lead, Chromium and Cadmium. Stata version 15 was   used for data analysis.  The fisher’s exact test was used to test for associations between the   quality of packag ed water and quality control measures.    The study found that 35.3 percent  of the packaged water produced in Lusaka did not comply   with the standard for drinking water on bacteriological quality. It also found that the   concentrations for Lead were less than  0.01mg/l in all the 17  samples, thus compliant to   WHO/ZABS standards.   Concentrations of Chromium were between 0.002mg/l and 0.62mg/l   and co mpliance to the standard was 11.8  percent.   Concentrations for Cadmium were as low as   0.009mg/l and as high as 0.2 mg/l as such, non -compliant . All brands of packaged water from   companies inspected quarterly by Lusaka City Council were compliant to the bacteriological   standards of drinking water.  Packaged water produced by companies that own bacteriological   laboratori es accounted for 47.1 percent  of satis factory results while only 17.3 percent  were   satisfactory from companies without bacteriological laboratories .  None of the companies had   means of removing heavy metals from water during processing.     Both the bacterio logical and chemical quality of the packaged water need to be improved to   safeguard the health of the people. Processing of the water should therefore target removal of all   bacteria and heavy metals.  Government agencies should also monitor the companies r egularly to   ensure compliance to standards.

People with   epilepsy (PWE) in  low-income countries often do not receive appropriate treatment, which   besides the continuing epileptic seizures, may also lead to cognitive impairment, reduced quality   of life, stigma, injuries, and possibly death. The objective of this study was to desc ribe gaps in   epilepsy management in a T. solium endemic rural area of Zambia .    A cross -sectional study was conducted in Sinda district of the Eastern Province of Zambia   between August and October 2018. PWE identified from clinic records including PWE from a   previous study were re -contacted. PWE not recorded in the clinic records, but with a reported   history of epileptic seizures by community members were also included. Serum and stool   samples of PWE were collected and tested for cysticercosis and taeniosis  respectively. Two   questionnaires were administered, one to PWE and one to local healthcare providers  to describe   management for epilepsy, the reasons for non -treatment as well as, non -adherence to treatment,   and the associated risk factors.    A total of 146 PWE and 43 healthcare providers  were interviewed. Sixteen of the PWE were   diagnosed with definite NCC in a previous study . Samples were tested for 129 PWE out of the   130 who had never been diagnosed with NCC, and thereof 36  were diagnosed wi th probable   NCC following the Del Brutto diagnostic criteria . Forty -four percent of PWE were on anti -  epileptic drugs, however, only 26 (17.8%) were on regular anti -epileptic treatment, resulting in a   treatment gap of more than 82%. O ver 50% of healthcare providers  did not know the relationship   between epilepsy and NCC. The risk factors associated with lack of correct treatment were   stock -outs of anti -epileptic drugs, long distance to health facilities, lack of diagnostic equipment   and poor patient follow up , and PWE opting for traditional medicine .   The results of this study demonstrated that gaps in the management of epilepsy in PWE and NCC   are substantial  in Sinda district.  The causes are multifactorial, involving shortcomings on the   level of the health fac ilities, communities, and individuals. Significant improvements in the   supply and dispensing of anti -epileptic drugs, accompanied by closer monitoring and follow -ups   of PWE may be key in substantially reducing the management gap and subsequently address th e   challenges and suffering of PWE.

To determine the risk factors associated with ScCVD       1.5 Study justification    Diabetes has long been recognized to be an independent risk factor for CVD. Individuals with   diabetes have twice the incident myocardial infarction (MI) rate as the general population, and   survival rates are lower among individuals with diabetes once they have an adverse   cardiovascular event.48 Women with diabetes and CVD, regardless of menopausal status, have   a four - to six -fold increase in the risk of developing CVD, whereas men with diabetes have a   two- to threefold increased risk  of CVD compared to women and men without   diabetes.6,8  Diabetes acts as an independent risk factor for several forms of CVD. To make   matters worse, when patients with diabetes develop clinical CVD, they sustain a worse   prognosis for survival than do CVD patients without diabetes.6, 7, 8 Because individuals with   diabetes are at higher risk for CVD events than individuals without diabetes and are at risk for   future events if they have already had one, it is necessary to screen all patients with diabetes  for   cardiovascular complications.    The association of subclinical cardiovascular manifestations with level of glycemic control will   be evaluated in this study. Early detection of these subclinical cardiovascular manifestations   could help institute prevent ative measures to prevent progression of these cardiovascular   complications.

Numerous studies have been done on factors that   influence learning  in various subjects, but there seemed to be no study which examine d   the use of reflective teaching approaches in Civic Education lessons in secondary   schools in Zambia. This study sought to investigate the use of reflective teaching   approaches in Civic Education lessons in selected secondary schools in Lusaka   District.    The objectives of the study were to: Identify Reflective Teaching approaches used by   teachers in Civic Education lessons, establish benefits of using the Reflective Teaching   approaches in Civic Education lessons, identify challenges associated with the use  of   Reflective Teaching approaches in Civic Education lessons, and determine measures   that can be put in place to curb the challenges arising from the use of Reflective   Teaching approaches in Civic Education lessons. The study was guided by a   qualitative a pproach and the research strategy used was a descriptive design. Data was   collected using a reflective questionnaire and lesson observation checklist. Purposive   sampling was used to identify the participants in the study.  The participants included   6 deput y head teachers, 6 Civic Education heads of section, 6 social sciences heads of   department and 18 Civic Education teachers. The total number of the participants in   the study amounted to 36.    The findings of this  study established that: continuous professio nal development   (CPD), peer observation, role play, action research, demonstration, home -work and   class exercises were some of the forms of reflective teaching used in Civic E ducation   lessons. The findings  further revealed that time allocation, large numbe rs in classes,   lack of participation from learners were inhibiting reflective teaching in Civic   Education lessons. It was also discovered that reflective teaching trigger critical   thinking in the learners and it makes teachers to be aware of the learning n eeds of their   students. Based on the findings outlined above, this study concludes that the teaching   and learning of Civic Education can only improve if teachers are to pay attention to   reflective teaching approaches. If teachers do not improve on the use of reflective   teaching approaches, the goals and aims of Civic Education will not be realised and   the learners too will not become innovative and critical thinkers once t hey are out of   school. The researcher  recommended that secondary school authorities sh ould   implement the use of reflective teaching in all Civic Education lessons.

It has also  been identified as a subject within the   school curriculum that is used as a vehicle for equipping learners with the requisite   knowledge, skills, values, attitudes and dispositions relevant for producing functional and   effective citizens. The purp ose of this study was to investigate  the challenges faced in   teaching and learning of Social Studies in selected primary schools in Lusaka District of   Zambia. The objectives of the study were; to explore the challenges faced in the teaching   and learning of Social Studies, to establish the method s used in the teaching and learning of   Social Studies, to ascertain the benefits of teaching and learning of Social Studies in primary   schools and to suggest solutions to the challenges faced in the teaching and learning of   social studies in primary school s. This study used a descriptive  research design which   employed a  qualitative strategy in order to effectively address the issues raised by the   research questions. The target  population was the CDC Social S tudies Specialists, Head   Teachers, Teachers and Le arners. The total sample size was 39 which comprised of 3 CDC   Social Studies specialists, 3 Head Teachers, 12 Teachers and 21 Learners. Purposive   sampling technique; in particular, homogenous sampling was used to select respondents .   The data collection ins truments used were semi structured interview guide, observation   checklist and document analysis whose findings were analyzed thematically.  The findings   revealed that there were enormous challenges faced in the teaching and learning of social   studies includ ing; multi discipline and diverse in nature , limited training, shortage of highly   skilled human resource, ra dical transformation in the  field, increasing social inequalities,   diversification of the economy, teacher qualification, teachers  using wrong teac hing   methods, access and quality, cultural differences, wastage and stagnation, absenteeism, poor   teacher to pupil ratio, teachers  not  being involved in curriculum development, negative   attitude by both the teachers and the learners, teachers not underst and the aims, purpose and   goals of social studies, less time allocation on the timetable  and learners not having access   to educational  tours. Social S tudies also do not receive vigorous support as a vital part of the   school curriculum and that schools lac ked teaching and learning materials.  Although, there   were recommended methods for teaching and learning social studies, teachers still used   wrong methods and did not democratize these methods during lesson presentation. However,   if taught well, social stud ies have a lot of benefits to the learners. It was therefore   recommended that both teachers and learners are sensitized, motivated and supported on the   importance of Social Studies. Teachers as implementers should be involved in the process of   curriculum d evelopment. Educational tours and site visits should be made a must for   particular topics. Primary schools should be provided with adequate materials   (infrastructure, text books etc.) to ease some of the challenges they face in teaching and   learning of soc ial studies.

It can be used as an assessment tool for performance of hospitals, units or individual   surgeons. However, not much research has been done to assess its utility in resource limited   settin gs like Zambia. This study was undertaken  to assess the predictability of SAS in   laparotomy patients at UTH  in Lusaka, Zambia. This was a prospective cohort study. A total of   50 patients  were recruited , their intraoperative data collected and SAS cal culated . The patients   were followed up for 30 days. The primary end point was incidence of any major complication   and/or death as defined by the Dindo -Clavien classification . Two out of the 50 patients enrolled   were lost to follow up, leaving a total of 48 patien ts.  Age ranged from 17 to 89 years with mean   age of 38.8 years (SD 17 years). Out of the patients enrolled, 79 percent were male with 73   percent of operations being emergencies. Intestinal obstruction was the most common diagnosis   accounting for 31.3 perc ent followed by viscus perforation. Of the patients enrolled, 58.3 percent    had no complications. Overall, complications rate was 41.3  percent  which was consistent with   published literature. Deep surgical site infection was  the m ost common complications at 12.5   percent . Patients who did not develop complications had a  significantly higher SAS compared to   patients who did  (p<0.001). Mortality rate in the high risk group was higher than predicted by   SAS (p=0.23). Period of operation and gender did not signific antly affect the SAS of patients  (p   values =0.45 and 0.28 respectively).    This study confirms that SAS is adequate at predicting outco me in laparotomy patients in   resource limited settings like UTH.

Lusaka has over the years undergone a   rapid urban expansion in the growth of reside ntial areas without a corresponding expansion   in the provision of water and sanitation. The study is aimed at analysing the nature of   challenges faced in the provision of water and sanitation services in newly planned   residential areas in Lusaka. The study  sought to assess the nature of water and sanitation   provision in Kwamwena Valley, challenges faced by the residents in accessing water as   well as the challenges faced by the residents in accessing sanitation services in the area.   The study was based on da ta collected from 120 household questionnaires conveniently   sampled and supplemented by seven key informants purposively selected from institutions   with a stake in water and sanitation. The results obtained show that there is on -site   provision of water and  sanitation in Kwamwena valley. For water provision, the results   indicated that the main sources of water for the residents are private boreholes with   elevated tanks and submersible pumps (58.3 percent), hand pumps (20 percent), communal   taps (3.3 percent)  and shallow wells (3.3 percent) while others did not have onsite water   (13.6 percent). For sanitation, results indicated that the main sanitation facilities included   pit latrines which accounted for 45 percent, flush toilets 35 percent and Ventilated   Impr oved Pit -latrines (VIP) toilets at 20 percent. Out of 120 households interviewed, 56.7   percent of the residents reported that they faced challenges in accessing water while 43.3   percent did not, and the main challenges included costs of installing borehole s and drawing   water among others. For sanitation, results showed that the main challenges faced are septic   tanks filling up within short periods, the cost and poor pit latrine emptying services, poor   construction of pit -latrines among other things.  This st udy concludes that the inadequacy   in the provision of water and sanitation by LWSC given the population increase and growth   of new settlements leads to on -site provision of water and sanitation by residents. This is   however unsustainable and may cause both  environmental and health problems due to the   increase in the number of boreholes drilled and septic tanks built. As such there is need to   come up with a more sustainable way of providing these service to residents as areas are   planned .

The study was guid ed by the   followi ng objectives : (i) to describe how District Election Trainers apply adult learning   princ iples when training poll staff .  (ii) to identify  challenges faced by District Election Trainers   in the application of  adult learning princ iples when training poll staf f, and (iii) to explore District   Election Trainers  suggested  possible solutions on how  adult learning principles  can be applied    when training poll staff . The study employed a case study design with a qualitative approach.   The study population comprised  all District Election Trainers who participated in the 2016   election training in  Lusaka District  whose number was 180 . Purposiv e sampling was used to   select 4 5 District Election Trainers from the four selected constituencies of Lusaka District. A   semi-structu red interview guide  and a questionnaire  were  used to collect data.  Findings showed   that District Election Trainers applied adult learning principles  ; by allowing poll staff  to talk   about their experiences with elections, by using  proper language when addr essing poll staff , by   making  poll staff  participate  in the training. The findings  further  show ed how  role plays  were   utilised in the training  to depict real life situati ons. However, D istrict Election Trainers  were   unable to effectiv ely apply the principle s due to:  the large number of poll staff they had to train,    limited time allocated to the  training, and Some District Election Trainers did not know much   about  adult learning principles  later on  how to apply  them when training poll staff . The   respondents  therefore,  suggested that by recruiting more  District Election Trainers , extending   the training period  and introducing workshops where they could be taught on the principles   would help them apply the  adult learning  principles better  when training poll staf f and enhance   the training . Thus , the  study recommended that the Elect oral Commission of Zambia should    introduce workshops  or seminars,  where D istrict Election Trainers can  be taught on adult   learning principles comprehensively. The study also recommended that the government should    consider allocating more money in election training so that the commission could recruit more   District Election Trainer s to make training the numbers of poll staff manageable.

A high risk of mortality and morbidity is encountered in   patients treated with surgery for PPU. Patient stratification and appropriate management according   to pat ients risk of mortality, has been recommended as a way of trying to improve outcomes in   patients with PPU. The aim of the study was to investigate the factors associated with mortality in   patients that present with PPU managed surgically at UTH. This was a  prospective cohort study,   conducted at UTH -Adult Hospital, Department of surgery targeting patients with PPU that had   undergone emergency laparotomy.  They were enrolled using interview administered   questionnaire and followed up for 30 -days post -operation . The primary outcome was 30 day post -  operation mortality. The study enrolled 38 participants of which 35 participants met the inclusion   criteria, 88.57% (n=31) male and 11.43% (n=4) female. The age ranged from 14 years to 84 years   with the mode age ranges  20 years – 30 years and 40 years – 50 years. Most patients presented   with two (2) or more complaints. Abdominal pain was common presenting complaint in all the   patients and other complaints included, nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension and   constipat ion. 82.86% (n=29) of the participants presented after 24 hours of onset of symptoms,   17.14% (n=6) were HIV positive and 42.86% (n=15) were in shock on presentation. More than   half of the participants were assessed as ASA score III or greater. On admission  40.00 % (n=14)   had elevated serum creatinine and 37.1 % (n=13) had low serum albumin. 91.43% (n=32) of PPU   were gastric perforations and 8.57 % (n=3) duodenal perforations and the mode and median range   of size of perforation was 5mm – 10mm. Length of hosp ital stay ranged from one(1) day to 13   days with a mean of 7.29 days. 30 -day post -operation mortality was 34.29% and 40% of the   participants developed a post operation complication. Univariate binary regression analysis found   Age, ASA score, Serum creatini ne, and Size of perforation to be significantly associated with   mortality (p -value <0.05, C.I. 95%). Univariate linear regression analysis found HIV positive   Status, and CD4 cell count level to be significantly associated with mortality(p -value <0.05; 95%   C.I.). Multivariate binary regression analysis found no significant association with mortality of the   above variables (p -value <0.05; C.I. 95%). PPU is a common finding among patients with   peritonitis undergoing emergency surgery at UTH and is associated w ith high mortality. Univariate   statistical analysis found Age, ASA score, Serum creatinine, Size of peptic ulcer perforation, HIV   Status and CD4 cell count level to be associated with mortality. However, no factor was found to   be significantly associated w ith mortality on multivariate regression analysis.

Purposive sampling was used to select the respondents. Data was collected using semi structured   interviews, focus group discussions and non - participant observations. Data was analyzed using   thematic analysis and validated using in between method of triangulation.     Results showed that key stakeholders were involved in a number of actions towards the integration   of EE in th e curriculum. The contribution of most of such actions was however, found to be limited   mainly due to underutilization. With regards to collaboration, the study found that stakeholders’   collaboration towards EE was poor. Stakeholders merely informed each o ther most of the times   and did not truly involve or engage with each other.    In conclusion, the study showed that stakeholders’ engagement towards EE integration in the   Zambian school curriculum was poor. Based on these findings, it was recommended that key    stakeholders needed to engage in monitoring and evaluation of EE and in developing an effective   communication strategy to ensure that actions were fully utilized and collaboration enhanced   respectively.

The study aimed at assessing the instituti onal   arrangements for supply of water and sanitation services in Chinsali Urban in Muchinga   Province.  The objectives of the study were to identify the institutional arrangements for water   supply and sanitation services in Chinsali Urban,  to assess how the institutional arrangement s   affect water supply and sanitation services in Chinsali Urban  and t o assess the challenges and   opportunities of service delivery for water supply and sanitation  services  in Chinsali Urban.    The significance of the study was to gat her information on how institutional arrangements   affect the supply of water and sanitation services in urban areas. It will add to the body of   knowledge on challenges and opportunities of institutions and Commercial Uti lities (CUs).   Furthermore , policy ma kers in the water supply and sanitation services sec tor will be able to   make periodic assessments  on how institutional arrangements can further improve service   delivery. The study used a mixed method approach of qualitative and quantitative  methods  to   collect data in the field.  From 557 households connected to the CU reticulation system, 139   households were stratified and proportionally sampled  using probability  simple  random   sampling  according to residential density cluster,  while purposive sampling was us ed on two   key informants from the CU and one from Chinsali Municipal Council and probability  simple    random  sampling was used for communities with water Kiosks. The instruments for   collecting data included questionnaires, semi -structured interviews, focus g roup discussions,   field observations and documen ts review. Quantitative data were  analysed using  descriptive   statistics and  Percentage Analysis Technique (PAT) , while qualitative data were analysed   using content analysis.  The study  findings  showed that the  institutions that are responsible for   supply of water and sanitation services in Chinsali Urban are the Community Based   Organisations (CBOs), Chambeshi Water and Sewerage Company (ChWSC) as the CU,   Chinsali Municipal Council (CMC) Water Supply and Sanitat ion Unit responsible for urban   water supply and sanitation services and the Ministry of Local Government and Housing   (MLGH) through the Department of Housing and Infrastructure Development (DHID). The    study revealed that  the current water supply does not m eet the current water demand of the   population of Chinsa li Urban . From the 139  households , (61 percent)  received water between   one hour and four hours per day.  Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) also showed that water   supply was insufficient in communities tha t use water Kiosk s. O nly ten percent of the   households are connected to  the sewerage system of the CU . Respondent s were satisfied with   the billing and affordability of the water supplied by the CU. Challenges that ChWSC faces   are dilapidated infrastructure ; power outages and administrative bureaucracy due to   provincial separation . Water supply interruptions and limited sanitation services due to   population increase were the challenges faced by households. Findings from the study   showed that Chinsali Urban h as the necessary institutional arrangements for supply of water   and sanitation services like other urban areas in Zambia.  Four institutions were identified   (CBO), (ChWSC), (CMC) and (MLGH). The institutional arrangements  in Chinsali Urban   have  affected the delivery of water supply and sanitation services  in the negative and positive   way as evident from the findings in the study.  The major challenges to WSS services are   dilapidated infrastructure and power outages which reduces the CU ’s capacity from    performi ng at the expected level as service provision is compromised.  Chinsali Urban has   good opportunities to increase and improve WSS services due to the current project for WSS   services funded by the MLGH. The project is expected to increase water supply from t he   current 2,600m3/day to 7,400m3/day if and  when the project is finished.

God is at home, it\\'s we who have gone out for a walk.    The price of inaction is far greater than the cost of making a mistake.    Over and above, I thank God for the sufficient grace and strength throughout this PhD   Journey. Indeed as in HIS WORD: \"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made   perfect in weakness.\" 2 Corinthians 12:9 & “For I know the plan s I have for you,” declares   the Lord, “plans to prosper  you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”     Jeremiah 29:11.    I pray the “thank you”  prayer every day of my life for the abundant blessings that I have   received. Yet, it somehow does  not seem to be enough to only say \"thank you\" to those I am   about to recognise.

The study also sought to establish   the significance of the mechanisms and strategies employed in coping with racism with  the ego   defence mechanism theory of psychoanalysis and the stress and coping strategies theory   constituting the t heoretical framework. The study endeavoured  to identify and analyse;   characters that experience and witness  racism in the two texts, the defence mechanisms and   coping strategies used by the characters and the differences and similarities in the mechanisms   and s trategies used. The research was qualitative in nature thus it  employ ed a descriptive   research design,  explanations and interpretations of data were outlined upon analysing racist   cases, instances,  and experiences, defence mechanisms and coping strategies in Meridian  and   The Tongue of the Dumb . Findings were that the selected ch aracters; Lubinda and Merid ian,   employ similar defence mechanisms at times which are; humour, sublimation, passive aggression   and affiliation. The notable differences are that Lubinda also uses identification with the   aggressor while Meridian employs altruism, regression, dissociati on and reactive formation.   Further, both use emotion focused and avoidance focused strategies though Meridian   distinguishes herself  from Lubinda as she also utilis es problem focused strategies. The  findings   show that defence  mechanisms and coping strategie s are crucial in coping with unpleasant or   negative states, feelings and situations. The mechanisms and strategies help the two characters to   avoid, reduce, overcome, challenge and deal with racial prejudice and antagonism thus the   significance of defence mechanisms and coping strategies is manifest . The differences and   similarities demonstrate that defence mechanisms are general, applicable to daily challenges and   that coping is a fluid process and cardinal process.

The objectives of the study were to: i dentify functional literacy   programmes (FLPs) for women entrepreneurs available in Lusaka district; determine how   women entrepreneurs partic ipate in functional literacy programmes offered in Lusaka district;   establish functional literacy -related challenges faced by women entrepreneurs in Lusaka district;   and propose strategies that can address functional literacy related challenges faced by wo men   entrepreneurs in Lusaka district. A descriptive research design was employed. A sample of 65   respondents was used comprising 50 women entrepreneurs and 15 officers from non -  governmental organizations (NGOs). Interview guides and observation checklists were used for   data collection. The study revealed that functional literacy programmes available in Lusaka   district included skills development, educational literacy and awareness literacy. Other   programmes included financial and accounting training as well  as survival skills. It also revealed   that participation of women in functional related programmes was low despite the NGOs   respondents indicating a high participation of women entrepreneurs in their programmes. The   study also indicted that challenges face d by women entrepreneurs included inadequate funding,   lack of business information, low business returns, competition, poor record keeping, inadequate   selling space, and lack of supportive materials . Proposed strategies aimed at addressing these   challenges  included creating favourable lending rates by banks, creation of market places and   providing women empowerment programmes.  The study recommended that: t he government   should increase the number of functional Literacy programmes to encourage more women to   participate; NGOs should come up with better and efficient ways of reaching women and make   their programmes attractive so as to encourage high participation; government should invest   more in public infrastructure such as schools and markets to provide most  women with literacy   and better trading places; the government should consider creating a special revolving fund that   can be accessed by women entrepreneurs to help with their capital needs.

The element satisfying this condition is said to have the upper Browder spectrum  property (see De\\x0cnition 5.1.1). They went on to show that the connected hulls of  the upper Browder and the Browder spectra do not coincide in general, as well  as the conditions under which the upper Browder spectrum satisfy the spectral  mapping theorem.  In this study we extend these results to COBAs . Since every OBA is aCOBA;  it is actually concluded that some results on upper Browder spectrum of an OBA  element readily extend to COBAs:  For further research, we recommend that the COBAs; rather than the OBAs;  should be the default setting for studying Fredholm theory.  v', '123456789_7233_1.txt': 'v    DEDICATION    To my late grandmother, Milias Chikonde Mweye, m y late mother Alice Chisenga  my late   father George Chimfwembe Chatepa ; my cousin Charity Chimfwembe Chatepa who sa crificed a lot   for my education;  my wife Dora Manzi ; and to our children Leticia Mapalo Chatepa and Chikonde   Chimfwembe Chatepa who  went through different  hardships and  missed me a lot during my research.

On the other hand, according to the former World   Bank president Barber Conable (1986), good governan ce refers to “as a public service   that is efficient, a judicial system that is reliab le and an administration that is accountable   to its public. Conversely, bad or poor governance  is characterized by arbitrary policy   making, unaccountable bureaucracies and legal syste m, abuse of public office and wide   spread corruption.    It is also important to understand the conceptual d istinction between good   governance and liberal democracy as the two terms h ave been used interchangeably.   Good governance as earlier defined implies effectiv e management of public affairs where   as liberal democracy simply means free and fair par ticipation in public affairs. According   to Danziger (2005), liberal democracy constitutes e xtensive political and civil liberties   regarding participation, personal freedoms and oppo sition. It is normally characterised by   free and fair elections, upholding of human rights and rule of law. In this regard, there is   a strong relationship between good governance and l iberal democracy. That is for   effective management of public resources (good gove rnance) to be realised, people’s   freedoms and rights (liberal democracy) should be o bserved to allow their views to be   taken in the governance agenda. Therefore good gove rnance can only be archived if   people participate in their governance process full y through their rights and duties. In   most cases, multilateral institutions promote good governance alongside liberal   democracy as a basis for sustainable development. S ustainable development basically   entails utilization of a country’s scarce resources  to meet basic needs. According to the   Report of the World Commission on Environment and D evelopment (1987) entitled “Our   Common Future,” sustainable development is developm ent that meets the needs of the   present without compromising the ability of the fut ure generations to meet their own   needs. It involves improved living standards for al l, better protected and managed   ecosystem and a safer, more prosperous future.    The above understanding of sustainable development is the one that has been   embraced by multilateral institutions in the promot ion of good governance. Multilateral   institutions are organizations formed by a group of  nations to work on issues that affect   the member countries. These include political, econ omic and social issues.  For these   issues to be addressed adequately in any country, m ultilateral institutions believe that ', '123456789_3781_1.txt': 'vi    3.2 Literature review          33   3.3 Conclusion                42   CHAPTER FOUR: METHODOLOGY    4.1 Introduction              43   4.2 Research questions          43   4.3 Methods           44   4.4 Sampling procedure         45   4.5 Data gathering procedure        47   4.6 Data analysis          47   4.7 Summary                 48      CHAPTER FIVE: PRESENTATION OF FINDINGS       5.1 Introduction           49   5.2 Frequencies of staff responses           49   5.3Frequencies of audience responses       67   5.4 Focus Group Discussions        82   5.5In-depth Interviews         84   5.6 Conclusion                    88      CHAPTER SIX: DISCUSSSION OF FINDINGS       6.1Introduction          89   6.2 Research Question 1          90   6.3 Question 2           95   6.4 Research Question 3          98   6.5 Question 4           102   6.6 Research Question 5          106   6.8 Conclusion          110      CHAPTER SEVEN: CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS       7.1Introduction           111   7.2 Conclusion                 111   7.3 Recommendations         115      RFERENCES            8.1 References           120      9.0 APPENDICES   A.

Poor waste management can contribute to the   impact of urban flooding by blocking drainages and increasing debris. However, information is   lacking on the link  between solid waste management and floods in the city of Lusaka, Zambia . It   was for this reason that this study sought to establish how the indiscriminate disposal of waste   contributes to urban flooding. Specifically, the study sought to identify the type s of solid waste   produced by the residents in Kalikiliki and Kanyama Ward 10 settlements, investigate how solid   waste is disposed of by households and find out challenges faced by residents in disposing of solid   waste.  A total of 505 questionnaires were ad ministe red to any adult present at each  particular   household. This included 200 from Kalikiliki and 305 from Kanyama Ward 10. Semi -structured   interviews were conducted with 20 key informants from relevant institutions and observations   were also made. The r esults of the study indicate that the types of domestic solid wastes generated   in the study areas were mainly organic, paper, plastic, old and rusted metals, diapers and textile   wastes. The study was able to confirm and map points in the two settlements wh ere waste   contributes to flooding.  The study also confirmed that waste collection franchise  is inadequate in   Kalikiliki and Kanyama Ward 10 settlements. This was easily identified by persistent heaps of   uncollected waste found on ubiquitous illegal dumps. Therefore, residents in the two settlements   resort to unsafe and unsustainable waste disposal practices such as burning, burying  and open   dumping, which contribute to blockage of drainages. On the challenges faced on solid waste   disposal, it was revealed t hat residents of the two settlements have no designated damping places.   The study further revealed that residents’ perceptions indicate that means of solid waste   management contribute to the f looding in the study areas . The research concluded that open   dumping and depositing of waste in uncontrolled and unauthorized locations contribute to   increased flood events.  Based on the findings, the study therefore recommends that  Ministry of   local government and rural development through LCC should provide waste rec eptacles in large   quantities and place them at intervals of not more than 200 metres apart in both settlements and   even commercial areas.

Some of the factors that contribute   to the high levels of malnutrition which is described in forms of stunting, underweight  ,   overweight and wasting in children   6  -  23 months   include poor infant stimulation and   nurturing, inadequate dietary nutrients and recurrent   illnesses/  infections     which     result   in poor absorption of nutrients, poor cognitive development, growth failure and wei  ght   loss. The  se     factors are common in developing countries such as Zambia where only   11% of children in this age group are fed appropr  iately according to   WHO   recommendations. Based on this background, this   cross sectional   study   was done with   the aim of   inv  estigating the   association between     dietary intake  ,   prevalence of   illnesses   and     nutritional status of   children aged 6  -  23 months in Namwala and Mkushi     districts   of Zambia  . A total of 213 children were enrolled, 108 and 105 from Namwala and   Mkushi  ,     respective  ly. A detailed questionnaire, anthropometric assessment as well as   a complete stool analysis was done. Ant  hropometric, dietary intake,     socioeconomic   and demographic data collected was analysed using Anthroplus, NutriSurvey and   SPSS version 23 software  ,     res  pectively.   The study revealed that none of the children   were infected with intestinal parasites. However, 65.7% of the children presented with   an illness two wee  ks prior and/or     during the study.   Illnesses   identified   in the study   group included fever,   diarrhoea, vomiting and coughs.     In the two sites combined, 5.2  %   of the children did not meet the minimum dietary     diversity requirements for this age   group.   Overall in Namwala district, the prevalence of stunting was 11%, 3  .7% wasting,   3.7% underweight, 6.5  % overweight while Mkush  i district had 19% stunting, 3.8  %   wastin  g, 10.5% underweight and 5.7  % overweight among children aged 6  -  23 months.   The mean   H  eight  -  for  -  a  ge   Z     s  cores between Namwala (  -  0.51 ± 1.40) and Mkushi (  -  1.04 ±     0.95)   were   significantly different     (t  0.05     3.245  ).     Using multiple regression, the   variables independently associated with   HAZ scores     in this study are   child’s age   (months), household non  -  food expenditure and consumption of   mabisi     (fermented   milk)  .     Health status   was not significantly   associated with nutritional status while   dietary diversity showed a weak positive association with child nutritional status.

The objectives that guided this   study were: to establish the nature of socio -economic life of school leavers with   impairment; to assess factors surrounding socio -economic life of school leavers with visual   impairment and to ex plore the contributions (if any) of the curriculum to socio -economic   life of school leavers with visual impairment in the study district. The study employed a   case study research design supported by qualitative methods of data collection in order to   get in -depth information. A sample size of 26 participants consisting: 12 school leavers   with visual impairment, one Head teacher, 10 grade teachers of learners with visual   impairment, one Education Standards Officer (ESO), one Senior Education Standard   Officer (SESO) and one Curriculum Specialist for visual impairment from the Curriculum   Development Centre (CDC). The participants were purposively selected for the study. Data   was collected using interview and Focus Group Discussion Guides. Data analysis was done   using thematic analysis method.  The study revealed that although learners with visual   impairment used the same curriculum as the sighted in the main stream, it was too   theoretical and not quite relevant to the prevailing socio -economic detects in the stud y   district. The curriculum did not make significant contribution to the socio -economic life of   school leavers with visual impairment in the study area in that they continued to live in   poverty. The study further revealed that school leavers with visual imp airment continued to   depend on odd socio -economic activities such as begging in streets and heavy dependence   on their relatives for daily livelihood which was indicative of inadequacies in the   curriculum they were once exposed to. The inadequacies in the c urriculum, in relation to   socio -economic life of school leavers with visual impairment were attributed to: shortage of   qualified and specialist teachers; lack of pre -vocational skills content in the curriculum,   limited learning materials and equipment to s upport practical skill pre -vocational training;   inappropriate skills assessment process and lack of a clear linkage between school,   vocational and tertiary education curriculum. The study recommended the following:   prioritising pre -vocational skills traini ng in the curriculum for a possible uplifting of the   socio -economic lives of the would be school leavers in the study district, employing   qualified teachers specifically for training programmes associated with pre - and vocational   training activities, to ha ndle vocational skills related areas. Promote collaboration among   various stakeholders such as line ministries; churches; communities and Non -  Governmental organisations.

This is made possible by focusing   on the attitudes and beliefs of individuals. In this study, the experiences of male partners had a   potential of positively influencing the quality of antenatal c are pregnant women received during the   antenatal period.    The services provided and made available could influence how male partners perceived antenatal   care. According to Rosenstock, 1974, the HBM is based on three assumptions; Firstly, it  assumes    that  a  person  will  take  a  health  related  action  if  that  person feels that a negative health   condition can be avoided. Secondly, there is an assumption that a person will take action if that   person has a positive expectation   and that, by   taking   a   recommended   action,   negative     health condition will be avoided. Lastly it further  assumes  that  a  person  takes  a  health  related    action  if  the person  believes  that  she/  he can  successfully  take  the  recommended action. The    HBM  ha s  six  constructs  as earlier outlined, which  represent  the  perceived  threats and  net   benefits.    a. Perceived severity       In this study, men with pregnant women would realize the susceptibility of their partners to maternal   complications of pregnancy. Therefore, they would realize the consequences of not engaging   themselves in Another  is because in the model,   a   person rec ognizes that she/he is susceptible to a   certain problem, and realizes the serious physical, psychological and social implications that may   follow (Rosenstock, 1974).    b. Perceived benefits    A  person  needs to  believe  that  by  taking  a  certain  action,  it   will  assist  her/him avoid or    prevent  a  problem  from  occurring. It  is  this  belief  which  gives  them confidence  to  take    action  because  they are  sure  of  the  results  (Rosenstock 1974).If men as individuals strongly   believe that involvin g themselves in ANC would enhance the maternal experience of their partners,   it is likely they will engage themselves in ANC and promote wellbeing of their partners.    It was therefore established in this study that male involvement in ANC enhanced the experience of   antenatal mothers .

ACS is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease in patients   hospitalized with vaso -occlusive crisis (VOC). It is associated with a high risk of sickle cell -  related mortality and morbidity in children, including prol onged hospitalization. The aims of   this study were  to determine the prevalence of pneumonia in sickle cell disease,  and also to   determine  cells that are mostly associated with pneumonia in si ckle cell disease. Furthermore,   were  to determine outcomes of pne umonia in SCD and pneumonia for under -five children   referred to University Teaching Hospital.       The study employed a  cross -sectional design, using secondary dataset  from paediatrics wing   within University Teaching Hospital. Complete enumeration was applied.    Continuous data were summarised by means and standard deviation while frequencies and   percentages were used for categorical data. The data was analysed using  STATA version 13.0   (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).  Logistic regression was applied to assess   associations of study variables.    A total of 601 under -five children with pneumonia was studied for their pneumonia in SCD.   Out of 601 under -five children,  84 had pneumonia in SCD, while 517 had pneumonia  only.   The under -five children comprised of 53% (n=317)  males and 47% (n=284) females, their   ages ranged from 28 days to 59 months  years old,  with a mean age (±SD) of 2.8 ± 1.4 months   years old. The prevalence of pneumonia in sickle cell disease was 14% . Mortality for    pneumonia in SCD was 12.8% (n=15) while in pneumonia only was  87.2% (n=102).   Furthermore we established haemoglobin, red blood cells, white blood cells, mean cell   haemoglobin and monocytes as cells that are mostly associated with pneumonia in SCD.       The study achieved its set objectives, by determining pneumonia in SCD  prevalence,   haematological parameters which are mostly associated with  pneumonia in  SCD , and the   outcomes of pneumonia in SCD . Therefore,  the government through the Ministry of Health   and other partners need to formulate policies towards the reduction of pneumonia in sickle   cell disease burden in Zambia.

He did not only criticis e me but  endeavoured to inspire me to forge ahead   irrespective of whatever bottlenecks I encountered on the way to producing this work. For the   concerted efforts demonstrated on this dissertation, I wish to sincerely express my gratitude to   him.   Special thanks als o go to some scientists who helped to shape my study through   consultation. These are Professor Keith Mbata and Professor Philip Nkunika both of the   Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Zambia.  Given the nature of this study   and although i t was written from the historical perspective, it immensely benefitted from the   experts in entomology who shared relevant scientific knowledge about edible caterpillars.     These senior lecturers therefore deserve a pat at their backs for willingly acceptin g „too many‟   questions I posed to them. For their support, I am heavily indebted.    My utmost appreciation goes to some institutions and individuals whom I interv iewed   during data collection.  Of these interviewees the following ought to be mentioned: Fr. Justine   Chomba, Fr. Oscar Chishimba, Mr. Gabriel Chambeshi, Mr. Paul Kasonje, Mr. Mwe wa Chibwe,   Mr. Robinson Mulenga and  Mrs Precious Nganga . Lastly, but in no way least, I thank my wife,   Lombe Chizyuka for assuming the role of a father in a home and for t aking care of my three   sons: Aaron Emmanuel Mwanza, Jr., Andrea Bukata Mwanza, Lubono Mwanza and my only   daughter, Paulcheria Deborah Mwanza.

Particular focus was given to the role of China as a n   anchor of the destination network in terms of external demand shocks. The dimensions   considered were the effect of partner GDP  on metal exports  demand , the respon se of metal   exports  to external demand shocks and the importance of partner GDP growth  correlations in   international trade risk. The Vector Error Correction framework and the Exponential   Generalized Autoregressive Heteroskedasticity model of volatility were employed  using    quarterly data from 1995q1 to 2016q4.  It was found that, in the long  run, partner GDP has a   positive effect on metal exports  demand  while in the short run, metal exports are sensitive to   changes in real effective exchange rate and foreign  (partner) GDP . In addition, metal exporters   in Zambia perceive d external demand shock s due to a network of metal exports destination  as   short run opportunities during the period under study.  The study  further  finds that partner GDP   growth  correlations between China and Zambia’s other metal trading partners were more   important in explaining metal export volatility than individual output volatility in those partners .   However,  this risk tends to manifest itself through volatility in  the  exchange rate and barter   terms of trade . In view of these findings, d iversifying the geography especially through value   addition to metals as well as developing a well -functioning derivatives market  for hedging   against  exchange rate risk due to external demand  shocks  therefore become important   dimensions of policy in Zambia.

There is a   divergent view on use of pre -operative antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent surgical site infections    (SSI) after these surgeries.  The aim of this study was to detect if the use of cefotaxime had a   significant impact on prevention of SSI in children under 8 years undergoing elec tive i nguinal   surgery at the University Teaching Hospital s, Lusaka.     This was a cohort study. A total of 1 70 patients  below 8 years of age  undergoing elective   inguinal herniotomy, orchidopexy or  patent processus vaginalis  (PPV) ligation  at UTH s were   enrolled . 85 of these  received pre -operative cefotaxime while 8 5 did not receive any antibiotics    based on surgeons preference . A data collection sheet was used to record pre -operative   demographic details. Intraoperative variables and post -operative outcomes. No patient received   post-operative antibiotics. Follow up to  look for Surgical site inf ection  was done at 2 weeks   and 30  days according to  Center for Disease Control  (CDC ) definition of SSI.     Out of 17 0 patients, 11(6.47%) had SSI. Six  of the 85 that received surgical antibiotic   prophylaxis ( SAP) had SSI while 5 of  the 85 that did not receive SAP had SSI (P=0.551). Deep   SSI were seen in 2 patients tha t did not receive SAP (p=0.155) and grew Staphylococcus aureus   in their cultures. Only 1 adverse allergic reaction to preoperative antibiotics was noted.     Despite a lo w risk of adverse reactions, t here is no benefit of using pre -operative antibiotics to   prevent SSI in children undergoing elective inguinal surgery.

Infectious   complications after the procedure  can occur despite patients being on antibiotic   prophylaxis. These complications range from being mild to  severe and life -threatening.    Growing evidence attribute s this to the increasing resistance to the commonly used   antimicrobial agents.  The study therefore aimed at evaluat ing the risk factors of urinary   tract infections following prostate biopsy , establish ing the pathogens involved and their   resistance patterns.    Methodology:  This was a prospective cross -sectional study  of a consecutive cohort of   patients who underwent transrectal prostate biopsy at the adult Hospital of the   University Teaching Hospitals  between September 2019 and February 2020. All patients   meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled, demographic and clinical details were   obtained using a questionnaire. Rectal swabs and urine for culture were collected before   the procedure. A second uri ne sample  for culture  was collected one week after the   procedure. Data analysis was conducted using STATA version 13 and results with p -  value less than 0.05 were considered significant.    Results:  Of the 139 patients  who participated in the study, 18 (12.9% ) had a urinary   tract infection after prostate biopsy.  HIV seropositive status was a  significant predictor   for development of UTI after prostate biopsy. Escherichia  coli was the most common   pathogen isolated in the rectal swab (6 3%). In post biopsy  urine, Escherichia  coli was   isolated in 67% (12/18 ) of patients with UTI . Its resistance to the routinely  used   antibiotic (Ciprofloxacin ) was 83% (10/12) and sensitivity to Fosfomycin and   Nitrofurantoin was 100 % and 75% respectively .   Conclusion:  The prevalence of UTIs after tra nsrectal prostate bio psy was 12.9 % and E   coli was the main causative organism . HIV seropositive status, history of having been in   acute urinary retention and paraplegia  were  independent predictor s of UTI after prostate   biopsy.

Thus, four leadership styles , namely ; autocratic, democratic, laissez -faire and   instructional were investigated to determine the  extent to which they contribute to the  creation of   conducive teaching and learning  environments in colleges. The research engaged 372 participants   randomly  and purposively selected from principals, vice-principals, d irectors, Ministry of   Education officials, staff and students. Data were generated using questionnaires , interviews, focus   group d iscussion, o bservation and  docum ent analysis. Analysis of d ata was guided by positivism   paradigm and phenomenology . Statistica l Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 23   helped to analys e quantitative data whilst qualitative  was analys ed thematically. The Pearson   correlation and Chi square wer e used to assess the significance  levels of the variables  while Path -  goal and Fiedler ’s contingency theories guided the study.    The findings  highlighted  that there was a strong correlation between leadership styles and the   creation of conducive teaching and learning  environmen ts. Secondly , the findings  suggest  that   there was poor to moderate teaching and learning  environmen ts existing in colleges under all the   four leadership styles examined in this study . The statistical combining of these styles also showed   poor to moderate environment with negative implicati ons on teaching and learning . The  findings   further revealed that p rincipals were predominantly using autocratic and  to a small extent   democratic, laissez -faire and instructional  leadership styles which had  repercussions on how   colleges were  run and on crea tion of conducive teaching and learning  environments.  It can ,   therefore, be concluded that the four leadership styles studied have not positively contributed to   creation of conducive teaching and learning environments from the Zambian perspective . This has   repercussions on teaching and learning  taking place in colleges , as it implies that leadership styles   are not universal but their results premise on the context and way the style has been applied.     The study , therefore , recommends  that all principals s hould be  made  aware of the impact of their   style of leadership on teaching and learning . This thesis proposes the usage and adoption of hybrid    leadership style , which requires the blending of masculinity and femininity traits and   understanding of subordinates ’ behavio ur and attitudes in various situations to address the   challenges of leadership being experienced in the colleges . The study has developed the Vision ary   leaders, Dialogue initiator s, Cultural transforme rs, Interpersonal relationship builder s, Transparent   communicator s, and Team builder s and Resource provider  (VDCITTR) framework as  an   innovation to the current leadership styles prevailing in colleges today.

A descriptive survey   approach was used in this research and the sample comprised of 45 community sch ools   drawn from Mufulira and Kitwe districts, 45 head teachers, 100 teachers, 45 Parents   Community School Community Committee, two DEBS (Mufulira and Kitwe), three   officials from Non -Governmental Organisations, namely Zambia Open Community   Schools, the Fle mish Association for Development Cooperation and Technical   Assistance, and United States Aid Time To Learn project. The total sample was 195   participants. The statistical package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was engaged to analyze   quantitative data. Data wer e collected through questionnaires, interview guides, focused   group discussions, observations and document analysis of literature and institutional   records. The findings of the study showed that there were three types of curriculum used   in community school s namely, the Zambian curriculum of 2000, the skills, participation,   Access to Relevant Knowledge curriculum of 1996, and the Revised Curriculum of   2013. The majority of the teachers, that is 89 percent, indicated that they used revised   curriculum of 2013.  An examination of the Grade 7 results from community school   examination centres, for the period 2014 to 2017, showed that the performance of pupils   between those in the studied school and the government schools were similar. The   findings showed that resou rce mobilisation in community schools was a big challenge   because community schools were non -profit making organisations.  Resources were   mobilised mainly from the following: school fees; donations from cooperating partners   especially the United States Age ncy for International Development and The Flemish   Association for Development Cooperation and Technical Assistance; community   contributions; school fundraising ventures and the government. The structure for   resource mobilisation and utilisation was the Par ents Community School committees.   Community schools were monitored and evaluated by Resource Coordinators and senior   teachers of nearby schools. Out of 45 schools, the District Education Standards Officers   monitored only twelve schools. The study showed th at community schools enjoyed   some opportunities in the training of teachers in form of short pedagogical courses   organised by NGOs and cooperating partners through the government. This study found   out that community school pupils enjoyed the flexibility of fered by these schools in   terms of payment of schools fees, and school uniform policy. Administrative challenges   the schools faced were inadequate finances, inadequate infrastructure and learning and   teaching materials, and lack of trained teachers. In con clusion, community schools are   organized and managed by Parents Community School Committees thereby affording   the school managers an opportunity to innovate on activities responsive to their needs.   Monitoring of community schools though crucial to ensuring  quality education was   carried out by non -monitoring and evaluation specialists.

It mainly investigated the nature of student induction programmes offered in colleges of   education , barriers affecting the education of blind s tudents in the two colleges of education  and   avail able suppor t provisions . The study employed an interpretative paradigm, qualitative method   and phenomenological design. Using purposive sampling, a total sam ple of fourteen (14)   participants; eight (8) blind students , four (4) college lecture rs for special  education and two (2)   college administrators were picked for the study. Semi-structured interview guides and   observation checklist s were used  to collect data.  The study established that the nature of   induction  programs offered to first -years students in t he two colleges of education was mainly in   twofold:  actuali sation of students to academic practices and general familiari sation of all students   to the college environment. Although the study established that actuali sation of students to   academic practices enlightened first -year learners to their academic life at the colleges, narratives   of discontentment were equally espoused concerning the inclusivity of the program in relation to   absence of induction handouts in differentiated formats and the inability of  the colleges to   separately familiari se blind students to the college environment and absence of O&M tra ining in   colleges of education.  The most pronounced academic hindrances ex perienced by blind students   were linked to inaccessible and unpredictable coll ege environment, difficulties in securing   sighted guides during blind students ’ stay in the colleges, the dilemmas of repeatedly making   individual follow -up of their written academic work, assessment dilemmas ; lack of assistive   technology and non -existence  of resource rooms.  The study recommended that the two colleges   of education should undertake separate familiari sation programmes for blind students during   first-year induction , Ministry of General Education should institute policy provisions that should   compel colleges of education to provide O&M training to blind students , need for colleges to   improve their physical learning environments and need to promote buddy system approach and   other appropriate support provisions.

This study aim ed at   reaching an understanding of the extent to which the education process in secondary schools of   Lusaka district is supporting the development of creativ e thinking skills in learners.    In or der to assess creative thinking skills of secondary school learners, this study utilised a   comparative study design under the quantitative approach. Data was collected from a sample of   180 students from six private and public secondary schools within Lusaka district, using the   Torrance T est of Creative Thinking (TTCT) figural form -A.   The findings  of this study  have revealed  that, grade 12 secondary school learners , in both public   and private schools, had lower levels of creative thinking skills. Further , school type was found  to   matter in  the creative thinking  potential of the learner ; as private school learners displayed higher   levels of creative thinking skills than did public school learners. This showed that even though   secondary school students learn  under the same national curriculum , their display  of creative   thinking skills depend s on the kind of immediate environment they are exposed to during their   teaching -learning process. However, the study found that gender  was not a significant factor in   creative thinking potential  of learners  in that boys and girls revealed about the same levels of   creativity.    Based on the findings, this study recommends  that the Ministry of General Education ( MoGE )   through the Curriculum Development Centre (CDC) explore  methods  that will enhance  the   learning process so that it can support  the nurtur ing and development  of creative thinking skills of   the learning in dividual.  In addition, the study recommends that further studies be conducted in   order to find out what is making private school learne rs display better levels of creative thinking   skills than those of public schools.      ', '123456789_7367_1.txt': 'v    ABSTRACT       The Ministry of General Education introduced the Primary Language Policy (PLP) in   the 2013 revised curriculum framework that promotes the use of a familiar language in   the lower grades (1 -4) with a view to ad dress  the low reading levels among learners in   the lower grades as established by most researchers in the country. However, although   most research has revealed that the use of familiar language enhances the development   of emergent literacy skills among learners  in the lower grades, there is no empirical   evidence that the use of familiar language enhances literacy to learners with   intellectual disabilities. Based on this premise, this study sought to investigate the   reading levels of learners with intellectual di sabilities with the goal of examining the   extent to which the use of familiar language has addressed reading skills of learners   with Intellectual Disabilities and if not, to suggest effective strategies. The study was a   longitudinal design, conducted from 2018 September to 2019 September. The goal of   a longitudinal design was to track the changes and progression of the learners since the   same sample was repeatedly studied. This repeated study on the learners helped to   establish the cause effect of teaching reading in a familiar language.  Qualitative  and   quantitative research methods were used.  A mixed  research method was thought   befitting in the sense that it captures  both the ontological and epistemological   assumption to the study. The belief and value  of this triangulation is that knowledge is   a social construct and as such, the use of the familiar language which is used in social   interactions is perceived to enhance the acquisition of reading skills when learners are   taught in a language they are  familiar with.   Considering the research objective and the   theoretical frame work, a constructivism/interpretivism philosophical assumption was   the underpinning of this research.  The belief is that knowledge is created through   social interaction  and inter preted by people and experienced by people through their   interactions with each other . The  conceptual frame work of the  social cultural   influence on learning,  guided the study. Data collection was based on  the following:   Questionnaire  for teachers teaching  learners with intellectual disabilities, Basic Skills ', '123456789_7368_1.txt': '  v    TABLE OF CONTENTS    DECLARATION  ................................ ................................ ................................ .....................  i   THE UNIVERSITY OF ZAMBIA APPROVAL  ................................ ................................ .... ii   DEDICATION  ................................ ................................ ................................ .......................  iii   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  ................................ ................................ ................................ ...... iv   LIST OF FIGURES  ................................ ................................ ................................ .........  viii   LIST OF TABLES  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............  ix   LIST OF ABBREVIATI ONS AND ACRONYMS ................................ .............................  x   ABST RACT ……………………………………… ……..………………………………... xi   CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION  ................................ ................................ ..................  1   1.1 Intr oduction  ................................ ................................ ................................ ...................  1   1.2 Background of the Study  ................................ ................................ ...............................  1   1.3  Statement of the Problem  ................................ ................................ .............................  5   1.4  Purpose of the Study  ................................ ................................ ................................ .... 6   1.5  Research Objectives  ................................ ................................ ................................ ..... 6   1.6  Research Questions  ................................ ................................ ................................ ...... 6   1.7 Significance of the Study  ................................ ................................ ..............................  6   1.7.1 Delimitation  of the study  ................................ ................................ ............................  7   1.7.2 Limitations of the study  ................................ ................................ ..............................  7   1.8 Theoretical Framework of the Study  ................................ ................................ .............  8   1.8.1 Conceptual Framework  ................................ ................................ ............................. 12       1.8.2 Operational Definition of Terms  ................................ ................................ ............... 13   1.9  Summary of Chapter One  ................................ ................................ ............................ 14   CHAPTER TWO: REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE  ................................ ......... 15   2.1 Introduction  ................................ ................................ ................................ .................. 15   2.2 Overview of Literature Reviewed about Teachers‟ PCK of Probability  ....................... 15   2.3.

The objectives   were to: analyse the factors which contribute to absenteeism of learners from tobacco and non -  tobacco farming homes in Nkeyema district, find out the stakeholders’ perceived effect of tobacco   farming on primary school learner absenteeism in Nkeyema district and to device measures for   addressing learner absenteeism in Nkeyema district . The study was qualitative in nature and had a   sample of 44 participants who were purposively selected from two primary schools in Nkeyema   District. These participants were selected  from class teachers, lea rners from both tobacco and non -  tobacco farming hom e backgrounds, tobacco and  non-tobacco farming parents from the   communities of the two selected schools. A descriptive design was employed a nd data was   collected using sermi - structured  interviews and focus group discussions. Data was  later analyzed   themat ically. The fin dings of the study revealed that the major factors which contributed to   absenteeism  among learners from both tobacco and non -tobacco farming homes were;  working in   tobacco activities, doing of house chores, long distances from homes to scho ols and lack of   encouragement by parents . The study also found out that tobacco farming had a negative effect on   learner absenteeism in Nkeyema District  in that it exacerbated the problem of long distances from   homes to school through the camp farming syst em, tobacco farming promoted the over dependence   on children to do house chores when parents were busy with farm works. Tobacco farming also   promoted c hild labour. The study suggested some remedies which can be used to reduce lea rner   absenteeism in Nkeyema  District. T hese were; parents to be providing their children with the   educational requirements as a way of motivating them to attend school, sensitize both parents and   their children on the importance of regular scho ol attendance, increase parents - teache rs   collaboration on matters affecting lea rners and that the tobacco farming companies operating in   Nkeyema District should work together with the school administrators to introduce mobile   education program for learners in the tobacco farming camps.

The Shibuyunji virus, a novel tick -borne phlebovirus (TBPV) was recently  ident ified in   ticks in Zambia. To gain insights into the prevalence, distribution, and genetic diversity of TBPVs   in Zambia, 363 ticks infesting cattle were collected from Namwala and Livingstone districts in   Southern Province and screened for TBPVs  RT-PCR. The  L-gene of TBPVs was detected by PCR   from 19 (5.2%) Rhipicephalus  ticks in Namwala District  and confirmed by  sequence analysis .   Shibuyunji  virus was the only TBPV detected. The detected isolates at the nucleotide, and amino   acid level  shared 92.8 -100% and 98.1-100% similarity, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis   showed that the Shibuyunji  viruses detected in Zambia were closely related to American dog tick   phlebovirus  and formed  a well bootstrap -supported distinct cluster. This study highlights the   possible  role of Rhipicephalus  ticks as the potential  host for the Shibuyunji  virus and that th is virus   may be present outside the area of initial discovery. Furthermore, the study stresses the need for   more studies to be conducted to assess the potential impact o f TBPVs on animal and human health.

The study was guided by four research objectives:   a). to document how title deeds are processed and the standard time of processing and  issuing of   title deeds at the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources b). To determine why tittle deeds take   long to process Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources c).  To ascertain how the processing and   issuance of title deeds can be met within the sta ndard time. The study used a mixed methods design   to collect data from a sample of 120 participants. Data was collected from employees from the   Ministry of Lands, landowners and Meanwood Property Developers officers using a questionnaire   and an interview g uide. The study findings revealed that the standard time for processing and   issuing of title deeds was dependent on how soon the client presented the full documentation to   the Ministry of Lands and how consistent the client made follow ups to ensure the pa perwork was   worked on. The stipulated three months’ time was not always applicable to the common citizens.   Further findings established that title deeds which were processed by individual clients took long   to come out because the paperwork was not well com pleted, and they did not have sufficient time   to make follow ups. The clients who did not make follow ups with incomplete paperwork had their   files misplaced in the long ran and blamed the Ministry for not issuing the title. The processing of   the title dee ds at the Ministry of Lands was manually done and there was no electronic   notifications, but physical check up on the progress until the process was completed. Property   developers processed titles faster than individuals because they were familiar with the  process.   The study recommended that the Ministry of Lands should employ an online system of contacting   the clients after lodgment of documents so that they are notified on the next stage of their paper   processing of the title deeds. This can be done by li nking the file number for the client to their   email and phone numbers so that an automatic message is sent to the client on what needs to be   done next.

The study sampled   50 customers and collected data using questionnaires. A descriptive survey design was used in   the study. Quantitative data collected was coded and fed into a computer statistical software   SPSS to run the analyses. Descriptive data analysis entailed counts, percentages, cross -  tabulations, and measures of central tendencies. Correlation analysis was used to check the   relationship between dependent and independent variables. Qualitative data from the research   schedule entailed the use of thematic analysis techniques. The results were interpreted and data   were presented in tables for uniformity and ease of interpretation. The study found tha t the   customers at Stanbic Bank, Zambia were indifferent about the system timeouts on digital   banking platforms provided by the bank causes disruptions in service provision. The majority   of the males influenced this response as the majority of females disa greed with the assertion   that system timeouts cause any service disruptions. The researcher also found that network   problem when reaching the digital banking platforms was a major challenge in digital banking   systems especially among male customers, and th is led to customer frustration and   dissatisfaction. Among females, the length of time it took for reversals to be processed caused   frustration and customer dissatisfaction. These challenges led many customers to feel; online   banking platforms are unreliabl e. The study concluded that Banks need to use data and   behavioural analytics to improve and iterate the customer acquisition process continuously. By   identifying the friction points, where activities stall and errors occur, banks can make   incremental chang es to improve over time.  The study recommends that to have faster processes   in digital banking, there is a need by banks to invest more in robust reliable systems to reduce   incidents of failed transactions and transactional errors in ATMs, Mobile banking, and POS   terminals. Banks should further automate most services like loan recovery, loan disbursement   and introduce queue management systems.

The study employed e xplanatory sequential mixed research design .   The data collection ins truments that were employed were  the questionnaire, interview guide    and document review check list . Quantitative data was analyzed using Statistica l Package for   Social Science  (SPSS)  and reinforced with Microsoft excel , while qualitative data was   analyzed using content analysis .    It was found that there were a number of factors that are influenci ng voluntary employee   turnover in ZACL  and these include;  lack of employee recognition, lack of promotion,   recruitment process, leadership style, poor communication, unsatisfactory performance   evaluation, low salaries, lack of training and development, lack of conducive work   environment, lack of effectiv e retention strategies and job location.   The study found that   salary increment, salary market survey and employee satisfaction survey that were being used   by management as retention strategies were not effective. Therefore, the study found that   retention strategies that may help reduce voluntary employee turnover in ZACL are;  right   perso nnel placement into positions, g ood org anization policies, providing c ompetitive   salaries, Training and d evelopmen t, conducive work environment, effective communication,   work-social life balance and use of democratic leadership.

It was also noted that the home language of HI learners was Cinyanja, which is different from the   Sign Language and signed English used by their children with hearing impairment.

The   findings of the stu dy revealed that reading comprehension was not taught in the manner it is   supposed to. Most comprehension lessons we re characterized by testing instead of teaching.   The morale of most teachers’  vis-à-vis their topic was low and that was portrayed by the   manner in which they started and ended their lessons. Some noticeable features of   comprehension lessons observed were poor lesson presentations, unsatisfact ory general   lesson delivery, poor  teaching techniques, teacher’s non -reading culture and pupils’ lack of   confidence in some teachers. Others were insufficient reading materials in some schools and   the prevalence of outdated books. In a bid to address the challenges of teaching reading   comprehension in secondary schools, it was recommended that Ministry of Education should   introduce short refresher courses for teachers of English aimed at ensuring effectiveness in   teaching methodology and hence improving the quality of their lessons. That should be done   after every two years. To make that achievable, governm ent should allocate more funds to   Teacher Education in order carry out  such projects. It should also devise a policy that   promote s reading at pre -school, lower and middle basic school so as to make pupils already   familiar to reading as they get into second ary school. Government should further motivate   teachers by improving their conditions of service.

Unfortunately, research   shows that  millions of children around the world are at risk for violence, abuse, and   exploitation. There are several threats to the safety of children, most of which are   interconnected  (UNICEF, 2021). Therefore,  this study  focused on  the practices of secondary   schools in ensuring the protection of their children in Lusaka district of Lusaka province of   Zambia. The aim of this study was to explore the involvement of secondary schools in   protecting children from vi olence, exploitation and sexual abuse.    The study was guid ed by the following objectives: i). Describe the prevalence of cases of   violence, exploitation and sexual abuse among children in secondary schools in Lusaka   district.  ii). Explore the measures take n to protect children from violence, exploitation and   sexual abuse in selected secondary schools.  iii). Explore gaps in the actions taken to deal with   child protection concerns in selected secondary schools in Lusaka district.    This study employed a qualita tive methodology guided by a case study design  in the light of   learned helplessness theory . Additionally, the study adopted  systematic  and purposive   sampling techniques  to enrol four secondary schools and to enlist thirty -six (36) participants   respectively. The participants were distributed as follows: thirty -two pupils; one Headteacher;   two Deputy Headteachers and one Head of Department. The data of this research were   collected using focus group discussions with pupils and intervi ew schedules on school   administrators. The qualitative data were analysed thematically by comparing and   categorising participants‟ responses .    The findings of the study  revealed that violence, exploitation and sexual abuse are very much   prevalent in secondary schools . However, it is difficult to ascertain the prevalence because of   underreporting of these cases by the pupils. Cases of sexual abuse were found to be more   prevalent among the girls and cases of physical abuse were more pronounced among the    boys. The study also revealed that teachers are usually the perpetrators of these cases.    The study made six recommendations, three of which are outlined below: i). the  government   through the Ministry of General Education should strengthen the child protec tion policies in   schools, ii).  the government through the Ministry of Higher Education should introduce a   course in guidance and counselling , iii). School  administrators should get more involved in   the activities of the guid ance and counselling department.  ', '123456789_7438_1.txt': 'vi    much.

The target population wa s   496 class  Teachers  only, while the sample size of the study was 100 class teachers. The study   employed a descriptive research design, and questionnaires were used to collect data. The study   will be beneficial as it can be used to recognize the significance of motivation that substantially   impacts the profitability and performance of Teachers in public schools. This study will   enhance the teacher's performance by motivational elements to upgrade the instructive   structure. The study will also be b eneficial to policymakers and administrators as it   distinguishes significant methodologies to alter the conduct of teaching personnel on the way   to their job performance. The study found that many motivation(intrinsic) factors that influence   teachers 'work  performance, namely; recognition, responsibility, work itself, advancement,   growth and achievement while under extrinsic motivation, include; company policy and   administration, supervision, status, job security, salary, relationship with supervisors,   relationship with peers, personal life and relationship with subordinates. It was also found that   salary and work conditions under extrinsic motivation caused dissatisfaction with Teacher   work performance. The study concluded that intrinsic motivation and extr insic influence   teacher work performance. The presence of motivational factors can produce job satisfaction   which makes an employee motivated or satisfied, but their absence leads to no job satisfaction.   Therefore, poor hygiene factors can cause job dissat isfaction which makes an employee   demotivated, while better hygiene factors can reduce dissatisfaction but cannot cause job   satisfaction. The study recommends that the Ministry of Education or government provide   incentive packages to increase teachers' mot ivation. Particular attention should be put on   increasing teachers' salaries and increments because most teachers complained of inadequate   salaries to meet their needs. Increasing teachers' salaries will increase their morale to teach and   encourage equity between effort put into the job and promotion to encourage hard work and   good work performance.  \", '123456789_7441_1.txt': 'v    Acknowledgement    A dissertation is a long piece of academic  writing with coherent scholarly thoughts based on   original research.

From the evidence from the health institution records showed   that a significantly low number visit health institution for health issues.    The research objectives t hat guided this study were to:     i. explore lived experiences of learners with hearing impairment when accessing health services,    ii. describe the effects of poor health services on academic performance of learners with hearing   impairment and    iii. explore supported strategies in use to improve access to health services for learners with hearing   impairment or deaf people.    A qualitative methodology driven by Hermeneutics Phenomenology research design was applied. In   addition, purposive sampling technique was used to en list Ten LwHI to participate in this study.   Participants volunteered to voice their lived experiences and clusters of themes emerged thereafter.     Emergent from the lived experiences of LwHI were the lived experiences of LwHI when accessing   health services , poor health services Vs academic performance of LwHI  and improving access to   health services for LwHI  that represent their felt worlds while at  Musakanya combined school.     The findings of the study revealed that most of the LwHI health services were unmet due to   inaccessibility to better health services caused by poor communication, wrong diagnosis, lack of   privacy and confidentiality, discrimination, inadequate medical vocabulary for signs, poor health   education, Limited Institutional support staff a nd Negative attitude.      The study also unearthed that LwHI experienced poor health services which resulted into poor   academic performance due to absenteeism, prolonged admission at hospitals and low self -esteem   leading to dropping out of school. The study also looked at the strategies to use to improve access to   health services for LwHI or deaf people such as sensitization of health workers, involvement of LwHI   in decision making, licensed professional interpreters, mandatory sign language training for heal th   workers, use of assistive technology devices, extra time for medical consultation and universal sign   language dictionary.      Based on the findings of the current study, the researcher provides eight (8) recommendations among   which include: inclusive pol icy, active involvement, communication, mandatory training of sign   language to health workers, assistive technology, employ specialist interpreters, separate counter for   hearing impaired and improve on health education.

ABSTRACT    The purpose of the study was to explore the role of traditional marriage counsellors in resolving   marria ge conflicts in Senama village. The objectives included; to determine the nature of counselling   offered to married couples by traditional counsellors. Secondly, to assess factors that influence   accessibility of traditional counselling services among couples thirdly, to ascertain challenges faced by   traditional counsellors in conflict resolution and l astly, to establish measures to enhance traditional   counselling in conflict resolution.    An explorative design was used. A qualitative technique was used in the collection of data. The   qualitative techniques involved use of interview, semi structured interv iews, questionnaires and focused   group discussion. The sample comprised 51 participants. The findings revealed that majority of the   participants were aware of the existence of traditional counselling services and felt that such services   had the potential o f providing viable knowledge and information on marriages and in fact reducing   divorce and GBV although others still felt traditional marriage counsellors were not helpful.     The study also found out the factors that influence the accessibility of marriage  counselling included;   culture, unfaithfulness or infidelity were some of them. The participants also faced a number of   challenges when it came to traditional marriage counselling, such as; lifestyle or culture of the   contemporary generation, skills or qua lification of tradition marriage counsellors and the inefficiency   of legal institutions such as the courts of law and the Victim Support Unit. However, the participants   also mentioned some of the measures that could address the challenges, these include; i nculcating   traditional values in the future generation, revising the curriculum for traditional marriage counselling   and couples to minimise seeking help from traditional marriage counsellors.    The following recommendations that traditional counselling had  the potential of sustaining marriages   and could help to reduce rate of divorce and GBV if the society gave marriage counselling the outmost   respect that it holds in the society that is preserving  the culture among others . Furthermore, the   environments for  counselling should be improved to enhance privacy which most couples look for.   Lastly, that, marriage counsellors should have a common syllabus and not a tribal based one because   there a number of intermarriages in the recent years.

Both probability and non-probability sampling techniques   were used  to collect data which  was analyzed using both quantitative and qualitative   techniques. The study has revealed that school -community learning from the SHN program   has only minimally taken place but  has led to some notable improvement in nutritional   practice s in communities. The study has shown that school -going children are slightly more   knowledgeable on SHN matters than the  parents and that better hygiene and nutritional   practices were more practised at school than at home. The study has revealed that School   SHN coordinators manage the day to day running of the program but have no real decision -   making power which is the preserv e of the head teachers . It was also revealed that there is   very little collaboration between school management and the communities in the   implementation and management of SHN. The study has further revealed  that most schools   do not have any meaningful ways  of sustaining SHN . The study recommend s, therefore , that    the M inistry of General Education should revise the SHN policy to enhance  nutritional    learning in practic al terms . Schools should involve nutritionists in conducting needs   assessment in schools and come up with programs that can be carried side by side with   program like SHN so as to improve health and nutrition and well -being of pupils in and   outside schools . The MoE and MoH should make it mandatory  or encourage  for parents to   get involved in nutriti on learning and practice by making sure that they are not left out on   decision making and planning . The MoGE  should enlarge and  twin SHN implement ation to   Production Unit  programs including  gardening, citrus fruit production, growing of maize in   the school  farm, teaching learners on improved food production methods and agricultural   entrepreneurship skills, demonstration of sustainable agricultural methods like crop rotation   and conservation agr iculture should be sustainable.

Even though most banks provide similar services, like money transfer, deposits, loans, safety   vault keeping, insurance and other services, it is seen that consumers have preference to certain   specific banks. Banks still face issues with customers switching from one bank to another in   search of either better service, low cost, convenience of access, international transaction services   and many other unexplored factors. This study assesses the lived experiences of multi -banked   bank account holders at Manda Hill Mall  Lusaka, Zambia .       Data was generated from seven  purposively sampled multi -banked account holders using; in -  depth interviews , focus group  discussions , informal discussions and observations. Findings were   analyzed using thematic analysis. Fac tors that emerged contributing to multi -banking among   account holders were fraternity, proximity, customer service, security and brand loyalty. The   study through interviews revealed that proximity to banks caused the customers to be multi -  banked. The study  further showed that some banks have poor services which do not even   motivate the customers to continue serving with them hence multi -banking.  It was found that   online banking reduces the queues being experienced in some banks for the customers‟ problems   are solved through the click of a button. The study also found that  when customers  trust a bank   brand , it makes them loyal to the bank and when they are loyal they also encourage their   colleagues to join the banks to which they belong to. From the participa nts‟ perceptions, options   for reducing multi -banking were enhanced customer services, improved bank security, reduced   fraternity behaviour and enhanced proximity. Research findings showed that banks should ensure   that there is no unnecessary sudden closure s of branches across their network as this builds the   confidence levels in clients so much that customers feel their money is secure unlike when there   are continuous changes and short notice closures of bank branches and ATMs services.       Thus this study con cludes that most of the factors that influence multi -banking involve the   attitude of the account holders, dependency on fraternity, security constraints and poor customer   services. This study recommends that banks need to improve their service provision an d   strengthen relationships with their customers, and enhancement of security to the satisfaction of   customers. On the other hand account holders should be accorded chance to be well informed   and independent in making decisions based on scientific evidence as to which bank to bank with.

Th e study was guided by the following research   questions; what are the challenges faced by teachers on distant marriage? What are the factors   that lead to distant marriage on teachers? What is the impact of long distant marriage on teachers   and finally, to w hat are the altitudes of teachers on long distance marriage in the three secondary   schools of Choma District? These questions formed the main basis for the achievement of the   study’s overarching purpose highlighted earlier. The three main factors that cont ributed to   teacher’s leaving apart were employment, promotions and transfers. The highlighted factors can   stabilize  a family .Family life is important in every society because it comes with positive   benefits, which include good parenting, social fulfilmen t, economic balance, conjugal   responsibility, among others. Despite the importance of family life and the benefits that come   with it, government does not consider marriage values to be aligned to work. Certainly, the   positive effects of marriage may not be  ascertained by people who live apart on commuter   marriage.       Lived experiences of teachers on long distant marriage are of concern. The aim of this study was   to assess the lived experiences of teachers faced with long distant marriages and the dynamics on   perceived marital as well as job fulfilment in Zambia. In order to assess the lived experiences of   teachers on long distance marriage, three objectives guided this study that is; to assess the causes   that lead to  distant marriage on teachers, to explor e the performance of teachers on long distant   marriages and thereafter to establish teacher’s altitudes towards  long distant marriage.  Six main   components of teacher profession were: teachers’ family life, parenting, availability on duty,   performance, fi nances and communication.    This ethnographic and phenomenological research was conducted at three secondary schools of   Choma district. Ethnographic study is defined as a method of qualitative methodology that lends   itself to the study of the social interac tions, and behaviours’ of small societies, involving   participation and observation over a period of time, and the interpretation of the data.    Finally, the following recommendations were made; need for convenient change of station   process or by putting marr ied workers in reachable distances .Redesign the conditions of service   from individualized to a more family accommodative one, reduce on years to serve from one   station from 4 to 2 years respectively. Furthermore, improve the teacher’s conditions of servic e   to allow them to run two homes amidst economic pressure .In as much as government desires to   reduce on teacher pupil ratio in peri - urban and rural schools teacher motivation, is supposed to   be the base of employment, retention and promotion .A happy and  marital fulfilled teacher may   increase high productivity as compared to a frustrated one.    Key terms : Long distance marriage, deployment, promotion, transfers.

The water insecurity challenges in African cities are due in part to an interweave of   factors such as rapid and often unplanned urbanisation, poor quality of infrastructure and high levels   of urban informality. These limitations make informal settlements in African cities most susceptible   to high r isks of water insecurity. In Zambia, seventy -two percent of households have access to clean   drinking water  while seventy -two percent of Lusaka population lives in informal settlements with   very poor access to reliable water services . Lusaka has previously recorded fluctuation and reductions   in rainfall patterns and this has had a  direct bearing on w ater insecurity  in the city and its region .   Despite efforts by governments and various stakeholders to deal with rampant water insecurity   problems in African cit ies, including Lusaka, urban water challenges persist. The  issue  of water   insecurity remains unclearly characterized, and interventions are primarily reactive rather than   proactive, making failure of interventions eminent. By focusing on George sett lement in Lusaka, this    study aims to examine determinants of water insecurity and urban resilience in the water sector in   informal settlements of Lusaka. Data for this study were collected using semi -structured interviews,   observations, grey literature and media sources. Thirty -five community residents and nine key   informants from various institutions in the water sector in Lusaka were selected purposively to   participate in the study. The data were analysed qualitatively to enable the study drill -down to lived   realities through  narratives and themes. The findings show that the key drivers of water insecurity in   George settlement are centred on water scarcity and long distances to safe water sources (communal   water sources), underground water contamination as eviden ced by ‘deep community stories of dirty’    water. In addition to rampant vandalism of scanty water infrastructure and rinsing demand for water   in the community, George settlement faces a spiral of interweaved challenges such as physical   insecurity, high pove rty levels and near complete failure of urban planning. These complex issues   interact intensely to shape livelihoods and water use behaviours in a clearly visible water insecure   settlement . To survive in such a waterscape, residents deploy a diverse set of  strategies that include   ensuring multiple water sources for different uses, deployment of extreme water rationing measures   and use of innovative and climate -sensitive options such as rainwater harvesting. The study further   establishes while George has bee n upgraded many times, settlement upgrading approaches in the   area have  not addressed water challenges in the area and that city planning has not deployed an   integrated approach. Settlement upgrading efforts and city planning measures have not contributed   to resilience building in the  water sector in George settlement . Based on the findings, the study   recommends effective implementation of the  Lusaka Slum Upgrading and Prevention Strategy ,   increased investments in  water infrastructure  and establish ment of  devolved water management   systems and processes.

However, women   are marginalized in terms of access to and ownership of productive assets. In response, government,   civil society, private institutions and international donors are increasingly targeting women   smallholder  farmers in poverty reduction and food security programme s in rural areas. Despite   increased focus of donors towards i mproving livelihoods of women smallholder farmers, evidence   shows that benefits accruing to women farmers in development projects are often quite elusive. The   purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the Norwegian Women Empowerment Programme    on li velihoods of women smallholders in Senanga. The study identified benefits accruing to    programme  participants, how the programme  targeted the beneficiaries and how project benefits   affect economic status of beneficiaries. Th e study adopted a qualitative app roach based on   purposive sampling of 1 farmer group under the project which was the most accessible. Data was   collected using a semi -structured interview schedule, focus group discussion guide and key   informant interviews. Descriptive statistics and themat ic analysis were  used to analyse primary    data. Programme  benefits included ; trainings, agricultural inputs, credit and market access. Most   participating smallholder farmers benefited more from provision of farming inputs such as seed (74    percent ), fertilizer (72  percent ) and training (32  percent ). None reported benefits due to  credit and   market  support . On targeting of pro gramme  beneficiaries’  71 percent  said they joined the   programme  from self -interest after sensitization from Programme Against Malnutrition ( PAM ).   This targeting mechanism was criticized by key informants from The Ministry of Community   Development and Social Services  as having resulted in elite capture of project benefits. The study   also found that women smallholder farmers did not experience posit ive changes in all domains of   women empowerment as their freedom of mobility in public space was found to be lim ited to   attending religious functions and programme  meetings alone. The study recommends that project   participatory monitoring and beneficiary assessments should be carried out periodically to get direct   feedback from beneficiaries about issues around elite capture and preference targeting of   beneficiaries . To really attain women empowerment goals, donor projects should address the   agency domain by providing economic benefits high such as market and credit support . Finally,   that agricultural development Programme s with a goal to empower women smallholder fa rmers,   should focus on activities that result in changes in their agency (capabilities), structure   (institutions/ organizations  that surround them) and relations (power relations).

The fact   that the Parotid  gland is divided by the facial nerve into a superficial and a deep lobe entails that   this n erve is at high risk of injury during core needle biopsy and incisional biopsy and these two   procedures also complicate into seeding of malignant cells (in the case of malignant tumours) and   formation of salivary fistulae, but there is no evidence that FNA C causes these complications6.      Clinical diagnosis result s in over treatment of participants with inflammatory lesions (who d o not   need surgery and could be managed medically or conservatively) and benign lesions that had been   treated as malignant tumours with total Parotid ectomy with excision of the facial nerve resulting   in facial nerve paralysis4.      Clinical diagnosis has grave  consequences4:   a) It does not rely on a tissue diagnosis.    b) It has resulted in increased postoperative morbidity due to Parotid  surgery done for   inflammatory lesion or facial nerve excision done in a benign Parotid  gland tumour.        Studies have shown that FNAC has established a role in the diagnosis of Parotid  gland tumours as   indicated by Attilio et al12, Choudhury et al4 and Khandekar et al10.   FNAC can distinguish Parotid    gland cells from non -Parotid  gland cells, it can distinguish inflammatory from neoplast ic lesions   and benign from malignant cells. However these studies had also noted that due to overlapping   morphological features of Parotid  gland tumours, FNAC had at times failed to provide a diagnosis   and it had also failed to accurately diagnose malignan t tumours4, 9. This had been a source of   controversy for most clinicians and surgeons as to whether FNAC could be relied upon instead of   examination of frozen sections during surgery4, 9, 16, 17. But again frozen sections are not commonly   found in most cen tres and are not done in Zambia. Hence most patients had been operated without   preoperative diagnosis, without proper counselling and they had increased morbidity associated   with over treatment such as facial nerve palsy (3 of the 14 patients who had super ficial   Parotid ectomy in 2011), and under treatment in cases where lesions that were thought to be benign ', '123456789_7510_1.txt': 'v    DEDICATION    This dissertation  is dedicated to the Almighty  Jehovah for  giving me the power, wisdom and   strength that I needed to carry out the research, my husband Mr B Munye ta for his   encouragement and support financially, to my parents Mr and Mrs Tembo for laying a good   foundation on which I have built, also to my lovely d aughters Temwanani, Natasha and Mary for   their encouragement throughout my studies.

The objectives of the study were to establish the   underlying causes of teacher transfers from Chibombo district between 2017 -2018, to   investigate transfer trend of teachers from and to Chibombo district from 2017 -2018, to   determine the implications of these transfers may have on the overall educational dispensation   in Chibombo district.        The study was conducted in four government secondary schools in Chibombo district and   employed a mixed methods design. Questionnaire was the main instrument of data collection   in addition to interview guide, Observation analysis and document review. The collected data   was analyzed descri ptively using frequency tables. The study revealed the following   revelations; there is a transfer procedure in the Ministry of Education but it is not well known   to the teacher’s. Secondly the negative perception of teachers on teachers transfer has affect ed   teacher performance in a school. Thirdly, the transfer of overstayed teachers has both negative   and positive effect on teacher performance.         The study made the following conclusions; teacher transfers do exist in the studied schools   with a transfer  policy and being carried out by the Ministry of Education in Zambia. Transfers   in schools are liked by teachers since they increase on teachers’ innovativeness, flexibility at   work and also enables them to participate more in school activities which impro ves their   performance .Also teachers who overstay in the same school are demoralized, get used to   unchanged environment which creates lack of innovativeness and thus declining teacher   performance.  The researcher recommended that the transfers of teacher s  should be handled   fairly by the Ministry of Education; teachers should be encouraged to form associations in   schools or of the former members of their schools so as to be able to keep track of their friends   in case of transfers.     Finally, there should be stipulated duration any teacher is likely at least   to spend at any station or school. This will assist in eliminating the problem of overstayed   transfers which is creating discontentment among teachers in schools            ', '123456789_7524_1.txt': 'vii | P a g e        ACKNOWLEDGEMENT    This project would have not been possible without the guidance, help and support of many great   people.

The objectives   were: to assess the areas in which teachers were involved in decision making; to establish levels   of teachers’ involvement in financial decision making among various categories; to ascertain the   major constraints of teachers’ representation in selected grant aided schools in Choma District.    The study employed  a descriptive d esign and Vroom -Yetton -Jago Contingency Theory of   participative decision making guided the study. Data was collected from a total sample size of 25   participants that comprised 5 head teachers, 15 teachers  and 5 head s of department. The   instruments of data collection used were interview guides containing semi -structured question   items.    The study revealed that teachers  were involved in academic decision making which included   drawing  the agenda for school meetings, selection of school prefects, and discipline of learners   but not directly involved in financial decision making. Heads of department were representatives   of teachers in financial decisions. The study also revealed that heads of  department and head   teachers’ involvement in decision making was higher and minimal for teachers. Further , the   study revealed lack of direct participation of teachers in financial decisions.      The study recommends that administrators in grant aided schoo ls should involve teachers in   financial decisions so as to enhance collective financial decision -making. The Ministry of   General Education should provide training to teachers in the form of workshops, seminars and so   on, in decision making, for them to bec ome competent, and skillful enough to participate in   financial decision -making and hence make the school efficient and effective in achieving its   objectives.

The study was guided   by three objectives: To determine head teachers management of HGSFP in primary   schools, to establish strategies used by head teachers in resource mobilization for HGSFP   and to examine c hallenges faced by head teachers in management of HGSFP. Data was   collected using, interviews, and observation check list. Data was analyzed thematically.   The study sample was 46, comprising 15 head teachers, 15 SHN coordinators, 15 parents   and 1 District school feeding manager. All the respondents were purposively sampled   because they were privy to study information. The study findings showed t hat head   teachers manage HGSFP by: initiating structures, spearheading com munity sensitization,   community mobilization for participation and programme monitoring and evaluation. The   study further revealed that head teachers established good strategies in resource   mobilization for HGS FP. The strategies were : employment of permanent cooks, engaging   in income gen erating activities, asking parents to buy feeding utensils for their children   and incorporation of parents in the school feeding committee. Lastly, the study established   that head teachers were faced with five major challenges in m anagement of HGSFP which   were:  pupils leaving feeding utensils at home, poor quality of fir e wood, absenteeism by   voluntary cooks, parents‟ negative attitude toward the programme and time management .   The study concluded that head teachers deployed good practices and strategies in   management of HGSFP which has led to the attainment of the desired benefits of the   school feeding programme in the district.    Based on the findings, the study made the follo wing recommendations:  the government   should ensure that there is proper and regular Home -grown school feeding programme in   all public primary schools in Chipata District. Government must also supplement the   efforts of the donors so that when they are no more school feeding continues to run. The   efforts of the donors must also be appreciat ed and complimented. School management   should support the programme by coming up with several ideas such as setting out income   generating activities that would keep the programme running in an event when there is   delayed funding from the donors. The Local community should educate parents on the   importance of sending the children to school and the importance of the programme itself.    Parents should support the feeding programme by providing labour in cooking, providing   fire wood, supplying their children wit h clean plastic cups for meals, sending their children   to school so that food is not put to waste and also by helping to pay the cooks. Donors   should step up the brands of food by introducing more than what is there i.e. introducing   other meals other than the porridge being provided, introduce other forms of fuel other   than firewood. Lastly, the spirit of volunteerism among beneficiary communities must be   encouraged by way of attaching an incentive to the work the volunteers do.

Furthermore, business people can be considered as connectors who bring groups together.

The other challenge s faced by street traders included: lack of security in the trading   areas, theft and high rental charges by shop owners. These are issues of concern among street   traders.    The s tudy has established that the re is conflict between the local authority and street vendors   trading along freedom way and the peripheral of Soweto market. This could attributed to the   fact that these traders are operating illegally (without licences) echoin g from the Statutory   Instrument Number 44 of 2007, which calls street vending as a public nuisance.       These conflicts have negative impact on the livelihood of the traders as the study revealed   that there was loss of businesses that resulted into loss of in comes among the traders.   Physical damage to both government and private property was also incurred. In some   instances loss of lives had been recorded. Consequently these conflicts affect the economy   through loss of jobs, loss of revenue and tax collection by the local authority.

The study was aimed at investigating causes and esta blishing the   effects of the 2016 general election conflict which erupted in Namwala District of Southern   province, as well as to devise possible measures to mitigate the electoral conflict.    The study approach utilised was qualitativ e and the research desig n was case study, making   it a qualitative case study research.  For the purpose of obtaining desired re sults, the   researcher used semi -structured interview guide for the village headmen/women   respondents and focus group discussions for the youths who were t he key informants.   Qualitative research was applied because it is effective in soliciting information about   values, opinions and mores of a given demography.    Research findings reviewed  that post-electoral conflict  is caused by ethnicity, gr eedy and   demogra phy. These causes however, are so devastating that they lead to a destabilised   society. Electoral conflicts has effects such as destruction of both public and private   property, loss of plant, animal and human life and also leads to environmental degradatio n.    This entails that there is need for consented efforts by the officers and regulations for   conducting elections or otherwise the situation may be more violent as compare to the   previou s elections.    In conclusion, the study revealed the possible measures to the challenge of electoral   conflicts which includes enhancing civic and voter education, discouragement of regional   politics and political corruption which is a bad practice in a democratic government and   institution and law reforms to suit the current situation of elections in the country.

The study adopted a descriptive rese arch design. The   target population for the study were SMEs in the construction sector in Kalingalinga, Buseko,   Mtendere, Mtendere East, and Kabwata. These areas were chosen because they accommodate   a lot of SMEs that are in the construction industry. Strat ified and purpose sampling were   adopted so as to give each item in the population an equal probability of being selected. The   sample size for the study were 50 managers of SMEs, who were chosen purposively. The   researcher used a questionnaire as a primary data collection instrument. The questionnaire   collected qualitative and quantitative data. The questionnaire was administered through drop   and pick method to the managers working in the selected SMEs. The questionnaire responses   were checked, grouped into various categories to facilitate for analysis using descriptive   statistics. Frequency distribution tables were used to summarise the data from respondents.   The analysed data was presented in frequency distributions tables, pie charts and bar charts   for eas e of understanding and analysis.       The study established that SMEs in the construction sector in Lusaka District adopted   moderate strategic management practices in relation to the strategic management model. The   study also established that SMEs faced numer ous challenges in the running of their   businesses. The study further established that the adopted strategic management practices   influenced performance of SMEs in the construction sector in Lusaka District. The study   concludes that strategic management pra ctices have an influence on performance of SMEs in   the construction sector. The study recommends that owners of SMEs in the construction   sector in Lusaka District and other organisations need to adopt best strategic management   practices if performance of t heir enterprises were to improve. While adopting the strategic   management practices, they should always make sure that the process is as inclusive as   possible. It is also recommended that in order to reduce on high rate of business failures,   SME owners nee d to develop interest in improving their managerial skills through regular   training. Further, owner managers need to formulate superior strategic objectives that include   adoption of technology and innovation, business efficiency and good customer service.

The study was anchored on the following   objectives: To explore the leadership styles of the two major political parties; t o establish   whether or not the leadership styles of the two major political parties could influence violence   before, during and after elections; to ascertain whether or not violence was used as a strategy for   winning elections and to analyze  some campaign messages made by politicians so as to ascertain   whether or not they had the potential to influence violence before, during and after elections.    Methodologically, the study used a qualitative descriptive survey design. The following   instruments were used to  gather data: individual interviews, focus group discussion and   document analysis. Using a homogeneous purposive sampling, the study comprised ten (10)   participants from civil society organizations  and one (1) official  from ECZ. It also comprised   four (4) participants from PF and UPND, who were at management level and two (2) councilors   (one from each party). It further comprised fourteen (14) supporters including four youths who   had served in the security wings of the two political parties.    The findings o f the study have shown that all things being equal, there is a nexus between   political leadership and electoral violence. In the first place, the study established that political   leaders in the two major political parties mostly used leadership styles whic h were a mixture of   autocracy, dictatorship, personalized charismatic and laissez faire; all of which had the potential   to influence violence before, during and after elections. Secondly, the study established that in as   much as political leaders claimed t hat they preached peace, they mostly peddled hate messages   before, during and after elections. Lastly, the study established that in as much as they were not   the carriers of violence themselves, political leaders tolerated violence amongst their supporters    and further used it as a strategy for winning elections.    The study recommended inter alia  the need for political leaders to adopt democratic leadership   styles that would foster co -existence, peace, love and reconciliation. Also the need for political   leaders to refrain from issuing statements which had the potential to cause violence, and non-  usage  of violence as a strategy for winning elections or cowing losers into accepting election   results.

T his study looked at management practices of headteachers and teacher retention in   rural primary schools in Kalulushi District of Copperbelt Province. T eacher attrition can be as   high as 30 -50% in certain rural schools (Hobart 2001). The main reason teachers leave rural   areas is isolation: social, cultural, and professional (Collins 1999 ). Teacher  retention in   Kalulushi district possesses a threat to the progressive education sector and the development of   the nation. Managing teacher retention is important for ensuring quality teaching and learning   in rural primary  schools  given society.  A sample of 37  respondents were purposively and   randomly selected and interviewe d. Therefore, this included three  (3) Education Standard   Officers, two  (2) District planning Officers,  2 HROs and  thirty (30) headteachers  from the   selected rural  primary schools.  The study  was mainly qualitative in nature. Thematic analysis   was used to analyse data. This  study was premised under the main aim of investigating   management practices of head teachers and teacher retention in rural primary schools of   Kalulushi district. Teacher attrition is mainly ascribed to poor working conditions. Many of the   rural primary s chools are geographically disadvantaged and bring a lot of challenges to its   inhabitants.  In an effort to address this scenario a qualitative study was  conducted in Kalulushi   with thirty  selected primary schools to be the participating in this research. Pu rposiv ely head   teachers and education officers  were targeted and further a simple random sampling procedure   was implored to select the participa nts. These participa nts have enough experience concerning   teacher retention and its effect on the education of any nation . Data collected was presented   using percentages, frequency distribution tables and other descriptive statistics such as mean,   and standard deviation. This information was displayed by use of bar charts, graphs and pie -   charts. . The  study was mainly qualitative in nature and used a case study design. Thematic   analysis was used to analyse data. The objectives of the study were threefold ; to determine the   staffing levels of teachers in rural primary schools, to  assess the management pr actices of   headteachers  employ on teacher retention in rural primary schools and to explore challenges   headteachers face on teacher retention in rural primary schools.    The findings of the study revealed tha t management practices of headteachers and teacher    retention in  rural  primary schools was due to a number of contributi ng factors that included   lack of managerial skills , inadequate infrastructure, over -enrolment, low teacher morale, few   qualified teachers, rampant teacher and pupil absenteeism , lack of s ocial amenities  and   insufficient funding  and low staffing  levels. This included negative a ttitude for both   headteachers  and teachers, other stakeholders such as parents and learners towards primary   education.  Teacher  retention in Kalulushi district possesses a threat to the progressive   education sector and the development of the nation. Managing teacher retention is important   for ensuring quality teaching and learning in rural primary schools.  The recommendations were    that the local administrators were to address issues of incentives, extra allowances, teaching   and learning materials, work with local parents to build more houses, MOE to address issues of   allowances and salaries, other stakeholders like the council to a ddress issues of road network   and drill enough bore holes in rural schools.

In summary, through analysing the causes and possible solutions to the succession disputes it was   revealed that indeed there were a number of factors that led to the succession disputes experienced   in the succession of Senior Chief Tafuna. However,  it was also found that not all hope was lost in   finding a lasting solution to the succession disputes of Chief Tafuna. The many possible solutions   suggested and discussed provided a reservoir of idea which if employed were to bring peace in the   selection of Chief  Tafuna and other Lungu chiefs generally.

This study was both   quantitative and qualitative in nature . 51 general wo rkers were purposively selected and participated   in the study. Data  was collected through administering self-constructed questionnaires  and   interviews . The key findings from the study revealed that job security and appreciation at work of general   worker by  their superiors were considered the most influential intrinsic motivation  factors while extrinsic   motivators for work performance were wages /salaries. The study also shows that  general wo rkers have   developed coping strategies such as  running small -scale businesses to  sustain themselves .Workers  also   borrow money from leading institution or seek help to sustain their families.   There is a negative    relationship between job satisfaction and  work performance  where the general workers are not   satisfied with the ir work leading to reduced performance.  Most general workers continued working   because they have no other job alternative  as a secure source of income .    The study , therefore , recommends that the  hospital authority  should come up with motivating   factors suc h as awarding general workers who performs better.  It is further recommended that   Roan General Hospital and the School of Nursing should request from Ministry of Health  the   required numbers of general workers  and fill the  positions so that under -staffing w ound be   eliminated .

However, despite the frequency and   devasting effects of flooding in the area, people co ntinue to live in the settlement. In much of   urban Africa, adaptation to settlement flooding has been community -driven based on lived   experiences and the use of local resources and rudimental technologies. However, there has been   a contested debate regardi ng the value of local knowledge and experience in disaster risk   reduction for a wholesome flood adaptation response in African cities. Often viewed as   ‘backwards’, governments instead based on foreign  ideas have emphasized ‘advanced’ alien   technologically sophisticated and economically expensive approach es which are often non -  consultative and alien to local liv ing conditions. This study sought  to examine the rationalities   that influence the implementation of community -based adaptation strategies to mitigate  flooding   in Misisi. The aim was achieved by the following objectives: To investigate the role of   community governance systems for flood adaptation, to spatially map flood risk areas using   community and experiential knowledge, to identify community -driven adaptati on strategies and   to examine instances of differences between community and state approaches to urban flood risk   mitigation in Misisi. The study used a case study research approach . It was designed as a   descriptive and interpretive inquiry analysed  through a mixed  methods  approach . The study was   based on data purposively collected from 65 households and supplemented by 3 key informants   from state institutions with a stake in flood management and mitigation in the settlement. Key   methods employed in collecting  empirical evidence included semi -structured interviews with   flood -affected households , in-depth  interviews with  ward leaders, and state officials and   mapping of zones by the severity of flooding. Non -participant observation, primarily taking   photographs, complemented these methods. Data was analysed through descriptive statistics,   content and narrative analysis.  Spatial data were analysed using spatial modelling in GIS.    Findings show that the area Councillor, Ward Development Committee (WDC) and Zone   Representatives make up the main governance structure  in Misisi  which are responsible for   organising  the community to build community -based flood resilience systems. The study   identified t wo flooding zones namely low  and highly flooded based on geospa tial modelling and   the frequency of occurrence of urban flooding in the area . From a total of 4,965 houses  in Misisi,   64% of the houses fall in low flood risks areas, while 3 6% fall in high-risk areas. The community   has employed structural and non -structur e measures to adapt to floods. The most common   adaptation strategies used are the use of sandbags which are place d around their houses; raised   pit latrines and doorsteps; construction of embankments, small drainages, protection walls and   elevation of house  foundations and seasonal temporal displacement.  The research  findings  also   revealed that there is a lack of acceptance by the local government of local people’s knowledge   and their response to floods. This has resulted in conflicting rationalities between  state-led   approaches and the community. The conclusion emphas ises the need for more attention to flood   risk reduction and to working with low -income communities to design flood risk reduction   interventions that align closely with the priorities of local c ommunities .

Heavy metals are an important category of the industrial   pollutants due to their non -biodegradability. One of the most cost-effective  strategies for dealing   with hea vy metal contamination is p hytoremediation . Phytoremediation is a general term for using   plants to remove or degrade different kinds of soil pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides and   landfill leachates . In Kabwe, Lead pollution arising from the Lead and Zinc mine tailing has   continued up to date because the erosion by wind and water of the tailing materials, has not been   remediated. This study evaluated the  potential of vetiver and lemon grass for use in   phytoremediation of lead (Pb) polluted soils.  Soil samples were collected from Kabwe mine   tailings and near the mine (Chowa community) for the pot experiments in Pb concentrations of 0   mg/kg , 720.5 mg/kg  865.5 mg/kg , 1510 mg/kg , 1551.8 mg/kg  and 1587.7 mg/kg . The test plants   (vetiver and lemongrass) were cut to uniform heights (lemongrass 10 cm and vetiver 13 cm ). The   treatments (Pb concentration) were replicated four times and the study was done  for 120 days .   Both vetiver and lemongrass  grew in all the Pb contaminated  and Pb -free soils. There was a   decrease in biomass yield with increase in soi l Pb concentrations (from 134.0 g in 0 mg/kg  to 64.3   g in 1587.7 mg/kg , and from 98.0. g in  0 mg/kg  to 52.1 g in 1587 mg/kg  for vetiver and lemon grass   respectively). Both  vetiver and  lemon grass  accumulated Pb  which  was more in the ro ots than the   shoots (P < 0.05, bioaccumulation factor <  1). Lemongrass  accumulated on average 0.73% Pb in   the roots, and 0.13%  Pb in the shoot. In contrast, vetiver grass took up  on average 0.4%  Pb in t he   roots and 0.29%  Pb in the shoots . The translocation factor was less than  1 for both vetiver and   lemongrass hence,  both plant types may not be suitable for phytoextraction but  for   phytostabilization and revegetation of the Pb contaminated tailings.

I wish to particularly thank the Chief Mission and Hospital   Administrator, Mr Gordon Hannah, for the warm reception  and for according me the   opportunity for the two lengthy interview sessions. I also want to sincerely appreciate  Mr   David Katota, Assistant Hospital Administrator, for allowing me to interview the workers and   some patients at the hospital .

The  study,  was guided by  the   following objectives:  establish the number of military personnel pursuing Peace and Conf lict   Studies in Zambia Army;  determine the relevance of Peace and Conflict Studies to military   personnel; establish th e experiences of military personnel in pursuing Peace and  Conflict   Studies ; establish the challenges faced by military personnel in pursuing Peace and  Conflict   Studies  and suggest alternative strategies aimed at addressing challenges that military   personne l face in trying to pursue Peace and Conflict Studies.    A qualitative research approach using a descriptive phenomenological  research design was   used to conduct the study. The study targeted  militar y officers  from Military Training   Establishment of Zambia (MILTEZ) , Arakan, Mikango and Chindwin barracks. The   participants for the study sample were 40 and these included:  Commandant  Defence Services   Command  and Staff College  (DSCSC), the Chief of T raining, the Chief of O perations  and the    Commandant of the Peacekeeping Mission Training C entre  (PMTC),  by virtue of their   positions . On the other hand, convenience sa mpling was used to select the sample for  the   study . The study established that few military personnel were pursuing peace and conflict   studies in the Zam bia army. It was also established that peace and conflict studies helped the   military personnel to handle peace and security matters of the nation professionally, helped   the officers to manage and resolve national, regional and international conflicts and also help   the officers to remain current in knowledge and skills. On the experiences of the officers in   pursuing peace and conflict studies, it was established that the officers found it interesting   and easy to pursue such a programme despite the challenge s of securing study leave and   inadequate financial resources for undertaking of the programme .   Based on these findings, t he study concludes that peace and conflict studies are relevant to   the military personnel because the knowledge and skills acquired from these studies help   them to perform their duties professionally during management and conflict resolutions at   national, regional and international arenas.   In view of the above findings and the conclusion   drawn,  the researcher mad e the following recomm endations: The Government of  Republic of   Zambia  (GRZ ) through the  Ministry of Defence  (MOD ) to ensure that study leave is made   available to deserving  officers  so as to increase the chances of the military officers pursuing   peace and conflict studies ; the M .O.D to ensure that officers who are granted study leave to   pursue peace and conflict studies are elevated in rank upon completion so as to motivate  them    and also encourage others to under take similar  studies; the M.O.D to introduce education   loans at lowe r interest rate to officer s under taking a course of study in peace studies  to   facilitate payments of tuition fees by the of ficers under taking the studies and finally, t he   MOD  to ensure that the curriculum for the military personnel training is revised to  include   the component of peace and conflict studies at all levels of training so as to help each and   every military personnel acquire the knowledge and skills in peace and conflict management   and resolution.

Schools were doing   something about this situation. The Parents‟ Teacher Association in collaboration with school   administration had st arted to build classroom blocks and also lobbying from Constituency   Development fund to help in building new classroom blocks.     The study concluded that the implementation of the vocational career pathway was being   implemented in very difficult circumstan ces. The old infrastructure being used was also bad and   inadequate. If the government did not intervene now education provision in the vocational career   pathway will not be up to date and learning will not be taking place. The state will have   graduates wit hout the skills, knowledge and a changed behaviour to fit in any society beyond   Zambia. Based on these findings the study recommends that the government should first allocate   some initial funding for infrastructure, equipment, teaching and learning resourc es and   specialists before upgrading a primary school into a secondary school.

I t was  establishe d that the policy was not useful to low ability   learners  as it promoted failing  especially to the  illiterate learners and it also  contributed  to   low standards of  education .    In this study  it was  recommended that the MoGE should  stop automatic grade seven   progression to grade eight and re -introduce a reasonable cut off point for grade seven   selection to grade eight to ensure that  learners with  at least with a certain level of a bility and   knowledge enter secondary  school . It was also recommended that in order to effectively    progress learners , the government should consider the ability, literacy and knowledge levels   of the learner.     The conclusion was  that automatic progression affected learner performance. Most   progressed learners were found to be illiterate in English which contributed to poor academic   performance. The policy contributed to the low learner morale and self -esteem. Most   automatic progr essed learners were found to be passive in class with less hope to progress to   senior secondary school due failure to get concepts. It also contributed to high enrolment in   the classes which hindered chance and time for teachers to give each individual lea rner   attention and use of variety of teaching methods.

It is also important to understand that a waste management system should ideally   consist of environmentally acceptable waste management practices that are aimed at   minim izing waste generation from both domestic and industrial/commercial activities.      This study determined that in order for a solid waste management system to be effective, there   has to be collaboration between the community participation and government.  Local   government authorities are entrusted with the responsibility for the provision of solid waste   collection and disposal services.  It is the responsibility of the local government through the   respective councils to establish technical agencies that will  authorize contracting of private   enterprises and informal businesses (community based enterprises) to provide waste   management services. This study also concluded that  involving formal and informal sectors in   the management of waste will improve service d elivery and provide social and economic   empowerment for the residents and the various sectors involved.

The  study,  was guided by  the   following objectives:  establish the number of military personnel pursuing Peace and Conf lict   Studies in Zambia Army;  determine the relevance of Peace and Conflict Studies to military   personnel; establish th e experiences of military personnel in pursuing Peace and  Conflict   Studies ; establish the challenges faced by military personnel in pursuing Peace and  Conflict   Studies  and suggest alternative strategies aimed at addressing challenges that military   personne l face in trying to pursue Peace and Conflict Studies.    A qualitative research approach using a descriptive phenomenological  research design was   used to conduct the study. The study targeted  militar y officers  from Military Training   Establishment of Zambia (MILTEZ) , Arakan, Mikango and Chindwin barracks. The   participants for the study sample were 40 and these included:  Commandant  Defence Services   Command  and Staff College  (DSCSC), the Chief of T raining, the Chief of O perations  and the    Commandant of the Peacekeeping Mission Training C entre  (PMTC),  by virtue of their   positions . On the other hand, convenience sa mpling was used to select the sample for  the   study . The study established that few military personnel were pursuing peace and conflict   studies in the Zam bia army. It was also established that peace and conflict studies helped the   military personnel to handle peace and security matters of the nation professionally, helped   the officers to manage and resolve national, regional and international conflicts and also help   the officers to remain current in knowledge and skills. On the experiences of the officers in   pursuing peace and conflict studies, it was established that the officers found it interesting   and easy to pursue such a programme despite the challenge s of securing study leave and   inadequate financial resources for undertaking of the programme .   Based on these findings, t he study concludes that peace and conflict studies are relevant to   the military personnel because the knowledge and skills acquired from these studies help   them to perform their duties professionally during management and conflict resolutions at   national, regional and international arenas.   In view of the above findings and the conclusion   drawn,  the researcher mad e the following recomm endations: The Government of  Republic of   Zambia  (GRZ ) through the  Ministry of Defence  (MOD ) to ensure that study leave is made   available to deserving  officers  so as to increase the chances of the military officers pursuing   peace and conflict studies ; the M .O.D to ensure that officers who are granted study leave to   pursue peace and conflict studies are elevated in rank upon completion so as to motivate  them    and also encourage others to under take similar  studies; the M.O.D to introduce education   loans at lowe r interest rate to officer s under taking a course of study in peace studies  to   facilitate payments of tuition fees by the of ficers under taking the studies and finally, t he   MOD  to ensure that the curriculum for the military personnel training is revised to  include   the component of peace and conflict studies at all levels of training so as to help each and   every military personnel acquire the knowledge and skills in peace and conflict management   and resolution.

Zambia . Stress and   stressors are an inherent part of warfare because of the violence, the physical conditions, and   duration of operations. Stress represents “the mobilization ” of the body and mind to co unteract   stressors. The causes of stress will always be there as long as soldiers are deployed  in an   environment which is a br eeding ground, for example during operation s in battle front and   prolonged operation and other factors . Early identifica tion of st ressors and adverse effects can   minimize  the negative effects of c ombat and operational s tress (COS). Adverse refers to   physical, mental, and emotional manifestations; loss of personne l due to combat ineffectiveness .   The study therefore, was aimed at findi ng ways of reducing stress. With the following objectives:   to determine the causes; determine the adverse effect of operational stress and assess the role of   counselling in reducing operational stress in soldiers at Chindwin and Kohima barracks, the   study  revealed that counseling is one of the measures which can minimize the high le vels of   operational stress in  soldiers deployed and after, if incorporated in the training programmes by   utilizing the services of the professional chaplains and medical personne l.  A descriptive survey   was used in conducting the research. Collection of data was done by interviewing a sample   population of 50 participants and by use of questionnaires. Qualitative method was employed to   collect data. Qualitative research emphasizes understanding of verbal narratives. The method   was used because participants were met at once hence it saved  on time.  The participants asserted   that counseling can play a vital role through the services of military chaplain  counselors and   mental health pr ofessionals in Operational S tress cont rol for prevention, identification,   counseling therapy and treatment . Through questionnaires and interviews it was established that   those who were counseled received help than those who did not. In this case pro counse ling must   be extended even when the soldiers are out of stressful field in order to prevent unusual behavior   such as extremely d rug/alcohol abuse, in dulge in s exuality , malingering, absenteeism without   official leave, marital problems, financial indiscipli ne just to  mention a few.

It   drew out lessons learned from the past experience s of managers, amidst obstacles and   challenges , on how to restore a good work culture. Eight crucial steps that leaders new to   an organization should take to recreate a good work culture free from fraud were  presented.          It was recommended that managers should : - Encourag e and support training of all   employ ees in fraud and corruption risk management to get all  on the same page; identify   the indicators that show signs of a good work culture and that fraud / corruption is taking   place, monitor and control it; exercise  the five practices of exemplary leadership in getting   people to commit to preventing internal fraud; and develop psychological hardness in   curbing widespread fraud and corruption.

ZPPA has over the years been facing imprudent procurement prac tices in  government   institutions leading to the quality and quantity of procured goods and  services not meeting the   requested  specifications . In some cases actual expenditure is higher than budgeted funds.    Furthermore , this has led to most government projects not being implemented as plan ned and   also negatively affect  the standing of t he government with its stakeholders . It’s against this   background that the research sought to assess  the factors that  negatively affect prudent   procurement practices in public institutions in Zambia ( with specific reference to Ndola and   Kitwe districts) and to identify possible strategies as measures of intervention.    The research was qualitative and it utilized both primary and secondary data. The research   sampled procurement professionals from ten public institutions in Ndola and Kitwe cities of   Zambia. The study identified the main factors that lead to  imprudent procurement practices in    public institutions in  Zambia as unethical practices, political interference, lack of compliance   to regulations and procedures, size and capacity of staff in procurement units, inconsistencies   between local and international regulations, lack of ICT equipment and wrong perception s. The   assessment also  recommends the following strategies and measures in order to enhance prudent   procurement practices:  improve capacity of pro curement staff through training and   development, ensure procurement policies support prudent practices, integration of   procurement function s with ICT and minimize  political interference in public institutions.

The objectives of the study   were to:  find out the role of the community in the implementation of the localised curriculum,   identify barriers to effective school - community engagement in implementing a local curriculum    and e xplore ways that would enhance school - community collaboration in the implementation of   a localised curriculum. Both qualitative and quantitative research designs were employed. The   research instruments that were used to collect data were questionnaires w hich were administered   to head teachers and teachers and focus group discussion which were used to pupils and parents.   The total sample was 110 comprising 6 head teachers (six), 44 (forty -four) teachers, 36 (thirty -  six) pupils, 24 (twenty -four) PTA executi ve members and school board members). Using    purposive sampling, head teachers, teachers HOD, guidance teachers, grade 7 teachers and   parents were selected while systematic random sampling was used to select pupils.    It was revealed that  both the community and the school acknowledged the importance of   meaningful participation in the implementation of the localized curriculum in order to enhance   school - community linkage . It was also revealed that embracing community participation in the   implementation of th e localized curriculum was considered as a way of promoting and sustaining    the needs of the community such as traditional and cultural heritage (Umutomolo ceremony).    Further, the  study revealed that  most teachers and parents knew very little about reforms on   localization of the curriculum. Head teachers failed to effectively coordinate the program which   the researcher attributed to the head teachers inability to utilize managerial roles like planning,   coordinating and directing. Community members’ participa tion in the implementation of the   localised curriculum was very minimal. The school boards and PTA executives  at some schools   never played their roles and this was one of the barriers  to effective implementation of the   localised curriculum as a link betwee n the school and the community.

The   objectives of the study were to: investigate the challenges in the administration and management   of sports activities; establish how much support is rendered to teacher s involved in sports by the   school management in the implementation of sports activities; and evaluate the levels of   performances and competences of teachers in the management of sports activities.    The study used a descriptive survey design which employed the qualitative  strategy in or der to   effectively address the issues raised by the research questions. The descriptive research design   was used to establish the extent to which sports is managed in selected primary schools of Kapiri   Mposhi District. In any case, the method of data colle ction included in -depth structured   questionnaires and focus group discussion s, where some guiding questions were prepared to   collect subjective responses  from the learners involved in sports activities. The target population   included School Management Team s, sports teachers and pupils involved in sports activities in   some selected primary schools of Kapiri Mposhi District.  Both simple random sampling and   purposive sampling techniques were used to select the respondents.    As findings, the study  revealed that sports activities in primary schools continues to be poorly   managed because of lacking infrastructure, funds, sports equipment and having un-skilled and   in-competent teachers managing sports activities. The findings also indicate that  school   managers were not very supportive to the sports teachers in the management of sports activities   and learners lacked balls and sports attires like jerseys. Consequently, the current primary school   curricular does not promote „physical education‟  as an independent subject  to promote and   support sports  activities in primary schools .   As conclusion, the study revealed that the problems and challenges in the administration and   management of sports activities includes inadequate funding, poor and limited infrastructure,   limited  sports materials  and equipment,  and un-skilled teachers  to manage sports activities  who   are not supported by school managers .                                                                        Based on the findings above, the study recommends that there should be adequate and proper   sports infrastructure  in primary schools, adequate financial and material resources support from   the government  through funding schoo ls, and support from school managers . Equally,  physical   education should be revamped in the curricular and teachers should be trained in sports   management to trigger the management of sports activities process in primary schools.

The leadership structure s of such societies consist of a chief or a king, and   village headman and ot her local leaders. These are the people who take care  of the  day to   day happenings in the chiefdom or village and they help to make sur e that people live in   harmony. Despite the presence of all these leaders, conflicts still occur among the people   and this threatens the peace. The focus of this study was to investigate the occurrence of   conflicts in senior chief Ndubeni’s chiefdom and est ablish what method of dispute   resolution is preferred by the local people of this chiefdom  between the modern or western   dispute resolution mechanism and the indigenous or traditional dispute resolution   mechanism.    The study was undertaken in order to unde rstand how conflicts are resolved between   people  in a traditional society, particularly senior chief Ndubeni’s chiefdom in Mpongwe   district . The research process involved the collection of data through scheduled semi -  structured interview guides which were administer ed in person by the researcher in order   to obtain primary data. The major findings of the study were that the local people of senior   chief Ndubeni’s chiefdom prefer to use the indigenous method of dispute resolution  to the   western method . The two  methods of dispute resolution, the traditional and the western,   are available to the people of chief Ndubeni’s chiefdom but there is a perceived preference   for the indigenous method due to i ts easy accessibility and affordability  to the local people .    The study found out that the common causes of conflicts among the people in the   chiefdom include high consumption of alcohol especially by the younger members of the   community. The reason why there is so much beer drinking is because of lack of access to   educ ation and the lack of recreational facilities to keep the young people engaged. It is   therefore imperative that measures be put in place to address these issues which increase   the likelihood of conflict by establishing recreational facilities such as socce r fields,   basketball courts and other sporting facilities. Also, there is need to increase access to   education for the young people so that they can be kept away from the abuse of substances   such as alcohol.  It is also necessary that measures be put in pla ce to increase awareness   among the local people on the importance of both the indigenous methods and the western   methods of resolving conflicts.

What also came out were  the poverty levels which in some cases led to not having   three meals in a day. Motivation for teachers was also cardinal in producing good results.   Equating this situation to K alumbila district this is true. The North Western Province strategic   plan also talks about the need for strengthening the efficiency and effectiveness of the education   management system in the province.       Having carried out the study the following were my  findings it was discovered that most   schools were operating without setting goals as to where they were and what they intended to be   in future. Administrator interviewed also talked about having fewer teacher hence not being very   effective in managing the ir schools,  working with teams , multi tasking and managing groups   while  overseeing their school operations proved very difficult to most of the administrators   talked to. On the second objective little was being done to interpret the results which the sch ool   had. Only 5 schools indicated that they were having teacher group meetings. This was not a   healthy sign.    The following are my recommendations: firstly all administrators should be trained in   educational management. Secondly administrators should not b e left to act for a very long time it   de motivates them. The reading records kept by the school should always be used to make future   decisions.

This   enables them to have healthier children.      Research has confirmed the beneficial effects of fa mily planning on maternal and child   health.  Women’s use of safe and effective contrace ption helps reduce maternal mortality   and morbidity by reducing the number of high-risk p regnancies and births, and helps   lower child mortality by reducing the number of hig h-risk births. 18,50       1.3.2  Male Involvement      Men are frequently blamed for many of women’s repro ductive health problems.  They are   potential partners in and advocates for good reprod uctive health. However, family   planning programmes in the past have focused on wom en instead of men. Some of the   reasons for this scenario are that women bear the r isks and burdens of pregnancy and   childbearing, and that most modern contraceptives a re for women. 16 Other family   planning programmes have avoided men because they a ssume that men are indifferent or   even opposed to family planning. 14,28,32,34,47.

In order to assess the impact of distant  marriages on families   among  teachers in selected schools in Mazabuka, four objective s guided this study that is;  To   assess the prevalence of distan ce marriages in study district,  establish factors that might have   led to distance marriages in the stud y district, to assess the psychological impact of distant   marriages on famili es of teachers in the district and finally t o ascertain measures that ought to   be taken to reduce on the psychologica l impacts of distance marriages.  Four main components   of family focused on this study were; couples relationship, psychological  impact, parenting,   finances  and c ommunication.    This study adopted a descriptive survey research design.  The target po pulation comprised of   teachers and families  of teachers . In this study a non -random sampling procedure known as   Purposive sampling was appropriate used to select the Head t eacher’s , Teachers, families of   teachers in the targeted schools of M azabuka district.  10 Head teachers  were randomly selected   using simple random sampling, 20 Primary and Secondary  school class teachers  and 10   families of teachers.  A total sample of 40 respondents were selected. School class teachers and   families of teachers  randomly selected while head teachers were purposively selected.   Questionnaires , interview guide, focused group discussions  were  used to collect data.    In this   study  the qualitative and quantitative data that was collected was coded using thematic analysis   to ensure fast and efficient processing and identification of themes. The data collected in this   research was also analyzed using excel. Findings were presented by use of percentages, tables,   and pie charts.    Three main fa ctors contributed to distant marriages am ong teachers were employment ,   economic  factor and career advancement . Specifically the absence of a spouse impacted   negatively on a couples sexual relati onship s, where most o f the  responde nts were sexually   unfulfilled , others were emotionally dist ant with absent spouse while others cited the existence   of infidelity in the family  and frequent conflicts . Children who were significant members of   the family were equally affe cted by the absence of a  parent . Financial pressures and   communication  were aspects of a family affected  by absence of spouse/parent as recorded by   the respondents . Respondents indicated that issuing of transfers to couples involved in distance   marriages can be one solution that can reduce the increase in distance marriages.    The conclu sion of this study was that distance marriage is an emotional issue that needs to   address using the measures mentioned above by the relevant authori ty.   Based on the findings , the following recommendations were made; improvement on transfer   systems, the need to train more teachers, during postings teachers should be given opportunities   to choose were to be posted, teachers should be allowed to seek the aid of on or off-base social   service and finally families should prepare for experiences in distance marriages by attending   counselling.  Further , students should be conducted focusing on the absent spouse and singles   in long distance relationships.

Phonemic awareness is the ability to distinguish an d manipulate the individual sounds   of language. This skill is critical for children wh o are still learning how to read.   Reading Comprehension is a complex cognitive proces s in which a reader intentionally   and interactively engages with the text. It is heav ily dependent on skilled word   recognition and decoding, oral reading fluency, a w ell-developed vocabulary and active   engagement with the text. If a learner has not yet reached this stage mentioned above,   then, he/she may encounter difficulties in reading and comprehending a text.   One of the aspects of reading comprehension is flue ncy. The ability to read fluently is   one of several critical factors necessary for readi ng comprehension. If a reader is not   fluent, it may be difficult to remember what she/he  has read and to relate the ideas   expressed in the text to his or her background know ledge. This accuracy and   automaticity of reading serves as a bridge between decoding and comprehension.   Another critical aspect of reading comprehension is  vocabulary development. When a   reader encounters an unfamiliar word in print and d ecodes it to derive its spoken   pronunciation, the reader understands the word bett er, especially  if it is in the reader's    mother tongue or familiar language. Otherwise, the reader must derive the meaning of   the word using another strategy, such as context, w hich is still very remote for most   grade three readers. (Even to university students)   Rapid automatized naming is the ability to quickly recognise and say out the names of   letters, objects and colours, and this predicts an individual's ability to read. It might be   linked to the importance of quick retrieval of phon ological representations from long   term memory in reading.    Phonics is a teaching method that stresses the acqu isition of letter-sound   correspondences and their use in reading and spelli ng. It helps beginning readers   understand how letters are linked to sounds (phonem es), patterns of letter-sound   correspondences and spelling, and how to apply this  knowledge when they read.

There have been a number of communication breakdown s between EHCAAC   management and the students.  This has usually led to poor relationships as   evidenced by student class boycotts and demonstrati ons.  These have usually   been violent and in turn tarnished the image of the  institution.  The effective   provision of the goods and services has also been n egatively affected.  This is   evidenced by student complaints on the quality of s ervices received (Djokotoe,   2009:20).      In order for higher institutions of learning to ach ieve their mission of providing   the much needed skilled manpower and contributing t o the social, economic and   political development of their countries and the wo rld at large, there is need for   effective communication strategies.

The program specifies that   beneficiaries will collect subsidised inputs from the program for three (3) farming seasons   only and graduate ther eafter but however, no beneficia ry has ever graduated to date. The   purpose of this study was to establish the reasons for failure to graduate from the FISP by   small scale famers of Ilume agriculture camp of Mkushi district. The specific objectives of   this study are to establish the farmer‟s awareness of FISP graduation pathways; to establish   the farm management practices among beneficiaries that would lead to self -sufficie ncy and   surplus production and  finally to investigate the sufficiency  of inputs receiv ed by each FISP   beneficiary.  A qualitative approach was used and a  purposive sampling procedure was  used   to select three (3) Ministry of Agriculture camp officers, while a  snow bow technique was    used to identify 40 small scale farmers who have benefited from the input programme for   four years and above  since there is was no  sampling frame.  Interview guides were used  for   MoA  officials while t hree (3) Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were  held with f armers.    Semi - structured questionnaires were also administered to  individual farmers.  Thematic   content analysis was used to analyse the data , while  Microsoft excel was also used to come   up with tables and charts for data presentation.  The results of the study show that FISP   beneficiaries were not aware of any graduation pathways and conventional farming methods   were  the most popular among which was  in contradiction to the highly recommended   conservation farming methods . The results also show ed that each F ISP beneficiary receive   one pack consisting of 2 x 50kgs of basal fertilizer, 2 x 50kgs of urea fertilizer and 1 x 10kgs   of hybrid maize seed  which are not sufficient . The study concluded that the possible reasons   FISP beneficiaries do not graduate are tha t they are not aware of any graduation pathways;   the lack of use of best farming methods have led to perpetual low yields and the insufficient   quantities of inputs each farmer re ceive was  only enough for food security , but not enough  to   lead farmers to inc reased incomes and pov erty reduction. This led the FISP  not to achieve the   objective of household food security, improved incomes and poverty reduction in full.  The   study recommended that beneficiaries should be made awa re of graduation pathways while   the use of conservation farming techniques should not only be recommended, but should be   made mandatory to all benefiting farmers. The study also recommended that the government   should consider increasing the inputs for each farmer to 2 times the current quant ities. This   will make farmers achieve the FISP objective s thereby leading to graduation.

Although this subject enjoyed compulsory status in all schools at that t ime,   it is hard to establish if it was  taught as such. In its attempt to revive PE, government   through its  2013 Educational Curriculum Framework introduced Academic as well as    Vocational Career Pathway Subjects . PE was made a Vo cational Career Pathway   Subject in this curriculum. PE had  become an optional career pathway subject. This   situation had seen very few schools choosing PE as a career pathway subject and this   became a concern. Thus, the study sought to establish the factors affecting the teaching   of PE in secondary schools. The p articipants included Standards Officers, lecturers,   head teachers, PE teachers and PE students. Data was collected through questionnaires,   semi -structured face -to-face interview schedules  and observation checklist s. From these   experiences, the study establ ished the status of PE in schools, the challenges teachers   faced in the teaching of the subject and strategies which they (teachers) used to cope   with the challenges.    It is no secret that physical activity is necessary to a person‟s well -being because it h as   immense benefits. The findings suggested that development of healthy young bodies   was one of the benefits of a school program me of PE. PE program mes in schools   directly benefited students‟ physical health, improved academic performance, promoted   healthy  lifestyle, increased self -esteem and taught life skills. Therefore, it was   important that students in schools engaged in PE activities owing to the many benefits   associated with the subject.    The results also revealed that the status of PE as a subject was  very low compared to   other subjects in the school curriculum and so was that of its teachers against other   subject teachers. The introduction of new subjects into the already crowded curriculum   had seen PE and other non -academic (lower status) subjects lo se teaching time to   accommodate these newer subjects. The study also revealed that there were many   challenges which PE teachers faced in their teaching of PE and these included an   overcrowded National and PE curricula, lack of PE resources, lack or bad sta te of   facilities and equipment, large classes, and negative attitude by parents, head teachers   and non PE teachers.

Despite global efforts to scale up early infant diagnosis   (EID) services, in resource -limited, high HIV burden countries including Tanzania, the   coverage is still lower than the recommended levels.  The study was carried out to   determine HIV prevalence and factors associated with accessibility of EID among HIV   exposed under five -year children  in Muheza district, Tanzania.    Methods: A concurrent mixed methods design  comprising of cross sectional survey,   health facility survey and case study  design was conducted among mother/ guardian -  child pairs of HIV exposed child  and health care providers at Muheza health facilities   between June 2015 to June 2016 . Information on HIV status, socio -demographic and   other relevant data was collected using structured questionnaires, interview guides and   health facility checklist. Multiple regression analyses were done by using STATA   version 13.0 to examine the factors associated with accessibility to EID. Thematic   generation and analysis were done using Nvivo ve rsion 10.    Results: A total of 576 HIV exposed children with their respective mothers/guardians   were recruited. Of the 576 mothers/guardians, 549 (95.3%) were the biological mothers   with a median age of 34 years (inter -quartile range (IQR):30 to 38 years). The median   age of the 576 children was 15 months (IQR: 8.5 to 38.0 months). A total of 251   (43.6%) children were born to mothers with unknown HIV status at conception. Only   329 (57.1%) children accessed EID between four and six weeks of age. In the distric t,   EID testing sites were only available in 61% of health facilities. Children born to   mothers with unknown HIV status at conception (AOR=0.6, 95% CI 0.4 -0.8) and those   with ages 13 -59 months (AOR=0.4, 95% CI 0.2 -0.6) were the significant factors of   missed  opportunity to access EID. Children living with the head of household with at   least a high education level had higher odds of accessing EID (AOR= 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 -  3.3). Their likelihood of accessing EID services was three -fold higher among    mothers/guardian s with good knowledge of HIV infection prevention of mother to child   transmission (PMTCT)  (AOR=3.2, 95% CI 2.0 -5.2) than those with poor knowledge.   Mothers/guardians living in rural areas had poorer knowledge of PMTCT (AOR=0.6,   95% CI 0.4 -0.9) than those living in urban areas.

The purpose of the study was to establish the facto rs leading to low levels of participation in   Adult literacy programmes among men in Namwala Dist rict.   The study had two main objectives with the overall objective being to identify factors which   lead to low levels of participation in adult litera cy programmes among men in Namwala   District. The specific objectives were: to establis h why men enrolled into adult literacy   programmes; and to identify factors that inhibit me n from participating in adult literacy   programmes.   The study employed  a case study design. Semi-struc tured questionnaires and interview   guides were used to collect quantitative and qualit ative data. The sample size was 200   respondents as follows: 1 District Commissioner; 7 government departmental heads; 12   facilitators; 5 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) comp rising 6 men in each FGD, bringing the   total number of participants in the FGDs to 30; 50 non-participants and 100 participants.   The study established that both basic and functiona l literacy were being offered and that men   engaged in the programmes so that they could, among  other things, be able to read and write   and also improve their farming and livestock manage ment skills. It was further revealed that   some men chose not to take part in the adult litera cy programmes because they felt shy, felt   they were too old for any learning and that the pro grammes were a waste of time. The study   recommended that the government constructs infrastr ucture specifically for adult literacy   programmes and also that the providers of adult lit eracy programmes embark on sensitisation   activities of adult literacy programmes.

CS O had data on HIV and AIDS for the   general population but why it did not have specific  data for persons with disabilities is a matter   of concern. CSO is a national department that condu cts research and provides vital statistical   information on vital issues affecting the country s uch as poverty, housing, disease etc. It is   equally their responsibility to have data on disabi lities. The lack of statistics is a sign that the   disabled are marginalized and sidelined in research  studies and indeed their welfare. The hearing   impaired learners in particular are more disadvanta ged. The nature of disability they have makes   them find difficulties accessing HIV and AIDS educa tion. No studies in Zambia have been   undertaken to find out how many hearing impaired pe ople are HIV and AIDS positive and how   many have died from the scourge. However, learning from other countries like the United States   of America, The American Social Health Association (2001) estimates showed that between 8   000 and 40 000 deaf and hard of hearing were living  with HIV in the United States. This takes   into consideration care for the disadvantaged. Thou gh this was a positive development, the   American Social Health Association (2001) further o bserved that studies on HIV and AIDS   among the hearing impaired were limited and said be cause studies on the deaf and hard of   hearing were limited; it was unclear exactly how ma ny people within this sub-population were   living with HIV/AIDS. It was discovered that there was a continued communication gap in   delivering culturally competent care to the deaf an d hard of hearing and this problem perpetuated   misunderstandings about health risks and preventive  practices.  Further, in the United States of   America, the prevalence rate of HIV and AIDS among the deaf and hard of hearing is greater   than among the general population. As early as 1992 , experts estimated that the American deaf   population was behind by eight years in HIV knowled ge and awareness. This is according to the   US Health Resources and Services Administration (20 01). This is a lesson we should learn from   that investment in information dissemination about HIV and AIDS among the hearing impaired   people is dearly needed, lest the hearing impaired face extinction.   The right to information is universal but if inform ation is denied, the right is meaningless. The   deaf population equally has the right to protection  against diseases.

Global trends are that   perioperative mortality has declined over the last five dec ades.  Zambia has had two   published studies over the last 30 years. The initial study conducted by Heywood, Wilson and   Sinclair in 1987 revealed an overall sixth day inpatient perioperative mortality rate (POMR)   of 7.55 per 1000 operations which was more t han three times the current rate of high income   countries. Surgical avoidable POMR was highest at 1.93 per 1000 operations, followed by   administrative avoidable POMR at 0.85 per 1000 operations and then anaesthetic avoidable   POMR lowest at 0.53 per 1000 op erations. Some of the recommendations from this study   resulted in the establishment of a trainining programme in anaesthesia and critical care, and   procurement of modern anaesthetic and monitoring equipment. It was the lack of more recent   knowledge to asce rtain whether the quality of the Zambian surgical and anaesthetic services   have improved in keeping with global trends that made it imperative to conduct a   perioperative mortality study in the largest teaching hospital in Zambia as a follow up to the   initial study.                                               Over a six months period we prospectively identified all patients who died within six days of   surgery, having undergone a surgical procedure by either a general, regional or combined   anaesthesia at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka. All demised patients had their   records analysed by a specialist surgeon and anaesthetist to determine factors contributing to   their death by consensus. The causes of death were classified as avoidable, partially   avoidable and unavoidable. The deaths categorised as avoidable and partially avoidable were   further categorised into contributing factors, namely anaesthetic, surgical, administrative   cause or a combination thereof.  The data on denomenator was collected from t he surgical and   recovery room registers. The numerator was the total number of all inpatient deaths within   six days of the surgical procedure, with date of surgery being day one.                                      A total of 9775 cases were captured with 4 49 of these being lost to follow up. The   denominator was therefore made of 9326 cases.  Seventy nine patients were detected to have   died during the study period. The overall sixth day inpatient perioperative mortality rate   (overall POMR) was found to be 0. 85% (95% CI: 0.68 -1.06)   and the sixth day inpatient   avoidable mortality rate (avoidable POMR) was found to be 0.42% (95% CI: 0.30 -0.57).  The   sixth day inpatient anaesthetic POMR, surgical POMR and administrative POMR were found   to be 0.04% (95% CI: 0.01 -0.079), 0.19% (95% CI: 0.12 -0.31) and 0.19% (95% CI: 0.12 -  0.31) respectively. Compared to the historical indices from 1987 by Heywood, Wilson and   Sinclair the chi -square test revealed a difference of no statistical significance (x2=0.411 with   1df, p=0.522 ). With regard to the 24 hour inpatient perioperative mortality indices, the   overall POMR was found to be 0.30% (95% CI: 0.21 -0.44). The 24hr inpatient avoidable   mortality rate (avoidable POMR) was 0.17% (95% CI: 0.10 -0.28). The 24hr inpatient   anaesthetic,  surgical and administrative avoidable POMR were 0.02% (95% CI: 0.00 -0.08),   0.07% (95% CI 0.03 -0.16) and 0.08% (95% CI: 0.03 -0.16)  respectively.                              The perioperative mortality indices at UTH have not reduced in comparison to the hi storical   data from 30 years ago. This is contrary to global indices which have shown a downward   trend over the last five decades.

Zambia . Stress and   stressors are an inherent part of warfare because of the violence, the physical conditions, and   duration of operations. Stress represents “the mobilization ” of the body and mind to co unteract   stressors. The causes of stress will always be there as long as soldiers are deployed  in an   environment which is a br eeding ground, for example during operation s in battle front and   prolonged operation and other factors . Early identifica tion of st ressors and adverse effects can   minimize  the negative effects of c ombat and operational s tress (COS). Adverse refers to   physical, mental, and emotional manifestations; loss of personne l due to combat ineffectiveness .   The study therefore, was aimed at findi ng ways of reducing stress. With the following objectives:   to determine the causes; determine the adverse effect of operational stress and assess the role of   counselling in reducing operational stress in soldiers at Chindwin and Kohima barracks, the   study  revealed that counseling is one of the measures which can minimize the high le vels of   operational stress in  soldiers deployed and after, if incorporated in the training programmes by   utilizing the services of the professional chaplains and medical personne l.  A descriptive survey   was used in conducting the research. Collection of data was done by interviewing a sample   population of 50 participants and by use of questionnaires. Qualitative method was employed to   collect data. Qualitative research emphasizes understanding of verbal narratives. The method   was used because participants were met at once hence it saved  on time.  The participants asserted   that counseling can play a vital role through the services of military chaplain  counselors and   mental health pr ofessionals in Operational S tress cont rol for prevention, identification,   counseling therapy and treatment . Through questionnaires and interviews it was established that   those who were counseled received help than those who did not. In this case pro counse ling must   be extended even when the soldiers are out of stressful field in order to prevent unusual behavior   such as extremely d rug/alcohol abuse, in dulge in s exuality , malingering, absenteeism without   official leave, marital problems, financial indiscipli ne just to  mention a few.

However, the association between exposures to infections and   causal factors varies from person to person. Numerous factors are  responsible for exposure which may   be linked to the socio -economic status of the society, the geographical location of the country or   environment, the level of awareness of the society and the health system of a country to combat such   diseases. Economic a nd cultural conditions may contribute to perpetuating exposure to the disease. The   risk of exposure an d infection may  be reduced by r outine meat inspection . This study aimed to assess   the risk of human exposure to Taenia saginata  through beef consumption.    To achieve this objective, a three -tier study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of T. saginata in   slaughtered cattle, describe the beef consumption pattern among residents in Windhoek, and quantify   the risk of human exposure through beef consumption . The first study was  a retrospective review of   meat inspection records at a selected abattoir to estimate  prevalence. The second part was  a cross -  sectional survey to  gather beef consumptio n data from the study population . The final part of the study    used primary data inputs and the consumption survey to estimate the risk of exposure to Cysticercus    bovis  and possible risk factors contributing to the risk of exposure using Monte Carlo simulation -based   in the @Risk software embedded  in Microsoft Excel. Resear ch ethics was considered and applied in all   aspects.    The prevalence of bovine cysticercosis was  0.70% among the inspected beef carcasses. Beef consumers   were estimated to be 99.5% of the population . The majority consumed  40-50g pieces in a serving, with   the largest portion being 300g per serving. The number of cysts that could be found in a 300g portion of   beef was 5 (95% CI 1 -11). The probability of  human exposure  to T. saginata  was 0.0076%. Although   the risk of exposure  increased with the absence of home freezing of beef  and Post Mortem Inspection   (PMI) by  0.0094% and  0.109% , respectively , improving home fr eezing  and routine  PMI may reduce the   risk of exposure to  0.0038% and 0.0040% , respectively . Hence PMI and home freezing we re both   protective and contri buting factors to the risk of  exposure    The probability  of C. bovis viability after home freezing of beef and  C. bovis  viability in infected beef    after cooking were the most influencing risk factors. Therefore, i mproving home freezing, efficient PMI   and tho rough cooking of beef  coupled with one he alth approach are recommended  to reduce the risk .

The study further   investigated the coping mechanisms adopted by teach ers to deal with stress. The study adopted a survey    methodology.    Questionnaires and Focus Group Discussions were use d to collect data. One hundred and fifty teachers   were randomly selected in 15 basic schools in Lusak a Urban districts. Quantitative data was analyzed   using SPSS Version 16. Qualitative data was analyze d using content analysis techniques. The study   covered only Lusaka Urban Basic Schools thus limiti ng the scope and extent to which the findings could    be generalized.   The study has established the existence of stress a mong basic school teachers in Lusaka urban district .   The findings have revealed that there were four maj or categories of stressors among Basic School   teachers, namely: poor conditions of service such a s lack of accommodation, low salaries, and difficul ties   of getting entitlements; poor school climate, for e xample, discriminatory tendencies among school   managers; heavy workload, for instance handling ove rcrowded classes and handling of more than one   session; low esteem among staff (including lack of recognition from the general public, work not   rewarding, and lack of regard for qualification).  The findings of this study suggest that the greate st   sources of stress among teachers in Lusaka region w ere conditions of service especially those   related to emoluments, for example, low salaries an d lack of accommodation. Another major   source of stress suggested by the study was work re lated situations, involving interruptions to   school programs, heavy workload, and overcrowded cl asses and so on     The major coping strategies used by teachers inclu ded engaging in extra activities to raise money to meet   accommodation costs, and soliciting for support fro m peers to deal with discriminatory tendencies by   administrators. The implication of these findings i s that teachers will exhibit multiple symptoms such  as   absenteeism, frequent permissions, low working mora le just to mention but a few all of which will affe ct   pupil performance.     The study therefore recommends that the Government of the Republic of Zambia should improve   teachers’ condition of service and working environm ents. It is further recommended that basic school   teachers should be provided with extra curriculum a ctivities and internet facilities to keep them   entertained.
